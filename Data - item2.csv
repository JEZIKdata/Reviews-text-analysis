1.0,"Good thermostat, but not ready for primetime yet (Updated)","  UPDATE 12/27/21: After a month it would fail to turn on the outside unit of my heat pump, only the inside unit, despite audibly clicking twice, and the Alexa app would say ""Delayed start"", as if it were on a cooldown timer, which the unit was not. This would happen both on scheduled times of temperature change and when manually changing it. Turning the breaker off and on would resolve the issue for a few hours before it would reappear. I ordered a replacement unit thinking that was the problem, but it did the same thing. I put my old ""dumb"" digital thermostat, the Lux TX9100E, for which there is a newer version (Amazon ID B00CX2QA3Y), back on and I haven't had a problem since.Changed star rating to 1 and will say to avoid this thermostat, it's not worth potentially risking damage to your system, especially when all of the issues mentioned in my original review were not addressed before the much larger issue occurred.-----------------------------------------------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW:This review pertains to the unit with Device Software Version 16843520 and Manufacturer Software Version 16844544.This is my first venture into a smart thermostat. I've wanted a Nest or one from Honeywell for a while, but their high price tags put me off. Enter the $60 Amazon Smart Thermostat. Installation was fairly easy, I say fairly because since the thermostat is small, the wiring can get cramped. The optional included backplate is quite large, which is a GOOD THING in my case as it easily covered several holes from previous thermostats. Connecting it to Alexa is also easy, just tell it to discover devices and it proceeds smoothly.There are a few negatives though. I waited 10 days to write this review hoping they would release an update that would fix them, but so far they have not.1) It has issue reconnecting to the network after a power loss. I had to pull it off the wall (it clips on to the mounting bracket) and put it back on to get it to reconnect after a few seconds long power failure today due to storms. My router is connected to a battery backup so it never lost power.2) The scheduling is very basic. You can only set 4 fixed temperature types (Work, Home, Away, Asleep) and assign them to certain times, and you can't adjust them differently. For example, you can't set 5AM and 5PM as ""at home"" and set the 5AM to 65°F and the 5PM one to 68°F, they both have to be the same. Also, as of this review anything you put in the Heat and Cool choices is changed by whatever you put in the Auto section, so it's only really possible to use it with Auto.3) Voice commands don't work well, or at all. When you say ""Alexa, what's the inside temperature"", it will often say ""Thermostat does not support this function"" when it does, same goes with humidity. Also when you say ""Alexa, raise the temperature by 2 degrees"", it may not work correctly, the last time I did that I wanted to raise it from 66°F to 68°F and the air conditioning came on because it had set the temperature to 64°F. There are also functions which are unable to (yet) be controlled with voice commands, such as turning the fan from Auto to On or Circulate, you have to use the Alexa app to do it.4) The display. Currently it will cycle between the Active and Inactive brightness at random, even when there is nobody and no sound in the room.5) This is a critical bug. About half the time when the heat is engaged it will also use supplementary heat (I have an electric heat pump with electric aux heat), even if the temperature outside is above 50°F, and it is just coming on to maintain temperature and been raised multiple degrees manually. Disconnecting the W2 wire fixes this, but also disables auxiliary and supplemental heat completely.6) There is no display for auxiliary heat in use on the thermostat nor in the Alexa app. Considering aux heat, especially on electric heat pumps, uses a large amount of energy, there should be some kind of display or, preferably, a popup notification."
1.0,I can't believe this is an Amazon product.  It's unbelievably un-smart!,"  I was so excited to hear that Amazon was releasing this product I preordered three of them.  I can't get any of them to connect to wifi.  All I can get it to do is say ""SEt"".  It refuses to connect to wifi after about eight hours of trying, power cycling, resetting, rebooting my phone, reinstalling the Alexa app, and all the crazy things support told me to do.  Talking with support was like torture, they copied the text from the manual three times and wouldn't address the issue only attempting basic support techniques.  Turning things off and on about a dozen times seems to be the apex of their technical support.  Don't get me wrong sometimes that works, except when it doesn't.  One support person told me I needed to install a Honeywell skill to make it work and select this Thermostat as a device, but I can't find it anywhere in the Honeywell App.Oh, Honeywell. I wish I had paid closer attention that they were involved in this.  I had a Honeywell ""Smart"" Thermostat once and I swore never to buy one of their products again.  A wireless thermostat that can't connect to wireless is what I would expect from a company like Honeywell (not Amazon until now).  Honeywell may know HVAC, but their website seems archaic and they seem stuck in decades-old ways of thinking when it comes to advanced technology like wireless.After spending so many hours, I think I will run down to my home improvement store and get a real thermostat so I can get the heat back on.  It seems so long ago that I thought this was going to be a fun quick project to kick off the weekend.  I am beside myself at just how awful support was.  It was the worst support I've ever received from any company and usually, my experiences with Amazon support have been great.  I was not expecting to run into any roadblocks.  I've installed lots of other Smart thermostats.  I thought this would be one of my simplest installs but if I did have issues, I was expecting Amazon support to have my back and they didn't.  They don't even seem to know that this is an Amazon product."
5.0,Simple yet elegant,"  Been holding off on smart thermostats until I couldn't say no anymore, and at $60, I couldn't say no anymore.Title says it all - they are simple, elegant, low profile, and easy to hook up. They are Amazon branded Honeywell's so they are definitely quality built.Install took me about 30 min each (none of my thermostats/furnaces had the c-wire hooked up so I had to do it myself - thank goodness the wires were there though). The app has step by step instructions, but really you just need to take a pic of your current thermostat's wiring.Pros:-Amazing value for what you get ($60 compared to $250 Nest)-Save money on utility bills (Smart thermostat)-Control with Alexa voice or Alexa app (works flawlessly and already integrated - no skill required for the app)-Control house temp remotely (very useful for vacations or when you're out)-Easy install (minus the c-wire)-Wife loves them!Cons:-None yet, but will update if I run acrossMake sure you don't sign up for the eco utility bill discount, unless you want your local power company adjusting your temp whenever they feel like it."
5.0,Amazing Thermostat for the price,
4.0,Great Device!-Setup instructions poor. Alexa said I couldn’t do it. She was wrong!,"  I’m loving this so far, but it almost went back. Alexa’s setup instructions are poorly done. After a big investment in time, parts, wires, waiting, and labor Alexa tells me this will only work on four types of furnaces and mine was not one of them. So Alexa was of no help with wiring my Rinaii Direct Vent EX38CT propane furnace. I had already bought a $70 remote thermostat wiring kit and 24 volt AC transformer so I was determined to make it work. Amazon seemed to indicate that I needed a Honeywell C-Wire adapter kit with this so I ordered one which was of no help at all. What I needed to supply voltage to the smart thermostat was a common 24V transformer often used in doorbell and Ring doorbell applications. And a little guidance to how that would be wired which I found online. Rinaii’s Youtube installation video on the remote thermostat was horrible. I destroyed the first transformer which wasn’t easy. Luckily I had another (about $18 on Amazon) and with the diagram shown I was able to complete the install. And YES it will work great on Rinaii’s with their remote kit which provides two black wires. Basically one of the black wires (no matter which one) hooks to the white wire which goes to the thermostat terminal “W”. The other black went to my common blue wire which tee’d to the thermostat “C” terminal and one of the “AC” terminals on the transformer (doesn’t matter which one). The red wire went from the other “AC” transformer terminal to the “R” on the thermostat. I am installing this on two direct vent rinaii’s which have never controlled temperature well with a little bulb sensor hooked directly to the heater. Now the heaters cycle and modulate the fan as they were designed to. I am thrilled. I had packed up all this to go back last night at 10pm before I changed my mind and decided to try and beat Alexa at her own game in spite of her telling me it wouldn’t work. It’s not the first time she lied to me and I am glad I gave these thermostats another chance. Amazon so far has not contemplated this being used for new installs or out of the ordinary applications. But it will probably work if you are patient. The photo schematic above will probably work for two wire installs that need a third “C” wire installs that need power as well. UPDATE: Subsequent to this review I received my second Amazon Smart Thermostat and found out that the two do not play nicely together. I have two furnaces and zones and we don’t want the same temperatures and schedules in the living room ends and the sleeping zones. I had seen this problem mentioned in another review but was hoping to find a workaround. I named them differently and installed them separately, but they still communicate and coordinate schedules. I can’t even use two different wifi frequencies since this only supports 2.4 ghz while other brands more commonly use 2.4 and 5 ghz frequencies.  I am sad that these will have to go back in favor of another more expensive brand. Most people don’t have zones or multiple furnaces so this won’t normally be a problem. But I thought I should update for those that do."
5.0,"Sleek and simple, not for fancy-pants types",
2.0,"Short Cycling, Not Impressed So Far","  Update: RETURNED! Easily one of the worst thermostats I've even owned. Not only short cycled but manually changing the temperature with the buttons had horrible lag and was not intuitive for family members because of the ""minimalist"" display. Bought a Sensi which is awesome and light years ahead of this piece of garbage. My recommendation is to avoid this and save hours of your life.Original: Easy installation. Easy setup. But awful in terms of how quickly it cycles on and off. My previous thermostat would cycle on and off every 30 minutes. The Alexa Thermostat is cycling every 10 minutes. There is no way to adjust the swing value to lengthen the temperature swings allowed before it turns on or off.  The swing value must be less than 1 degree because the temperature never moves off of 74 degrees, yet cycles on and off 5-7 times per hour. Honeywell please upgrade the firmware  to add this much needed functionality!"
4.0,"It has FAN only mode. Works as expected, A few glaring flaws",
1.0,"Disappointing. No manual, poor instructions, no help.","  Like most early adopters I purchased this prior to it's release and checked first to ensure I had the c-wire and didn't require an adaptor. Using the prompts for the set up on Alexa app is vague and unclear but more importantly, it's inconsistent. While the item site shows I'm okay and don't require a c-wire, the app says otherwise. Finally I called my cousin who works in HVAC but after an hour I released him from our video call because well, the device is simply not turning on. I put my old thermostat back in and boom, ac is working. Why release an item with no real instructions or troubleshooting websites to assist. It's like you intentionally set yourself for poor early reviews. Returning the item. Inadequate instructions, no manual, no quick customer service support. You played yourself Amazon."
4.0,Scheduler clock not in sync with local time.,"  Got the unit yesterday and installed it. After trying multiple times to set it up with my iPhone 12 and iPad Pro, setup kept failing reporting Bluetooth error. I was ready to remove it and re-install my old thermostat, then I decided to try the setup with an old iPhone 6S.  After running setup with the iPhone 6S, setup was able to complete.  Also, make sure the network to which your phone is attached before setup is 2.4 Ghz. The unit only supports 2.4Ghz.After completing setup and setting up a schedule, I was expecting the unit to bring the house up to 74 degrees at 6:00 am. At 6:00 am, nothing. It wasn’t until 8:00am that the heat kicked on.  This leads me to believe that the unit is on the wrong time zone but there is no way to set the time or time zone on the unit. I hope they have an update for this soon."
1.0,Lots of bugs in software and Alexa app,"  Going to return it. Heat mode doesn’t turn off on its own so my house is 90 degrees hot when I set it to 75. You have to physically turn on AC and then turn off Heat.  I think this is a new Amazon product and Alexa app is not in sync. Defeats the whole purpose of automation and saving energy costs. Since it will not turn off heat on schedule. I thought it was c-wire adaptor but this product is defective. Also the Alexa app settings don’t match the display settings.  Will try Nest thermostat instead.  Had high hopes but Amazon let me down this time. I have ring alarm, camera and other Amazon devices that work flawlessly."
3.0,It has potential.  Best price of any smart thermostat I've seen.,"  I've had this installed for one week.CONS:1. Alexa Hunches (machine learning suggestions) have a long way to go.  Pretty routine bet at 10PM and get up at 6 or 6:30 AM.  Alexa never fails to set Sleep temp around 3 or 3:30 AM.  5 hours late.  I haven't seen improvement even after a few ""Alexa, bedtime"" to help it learn.2. One day I went to the office to work and at 8:30 AM I received a hunch that set my ""Home temp instead of the Away temp.  I was expecting that to be a slam dunk based on GPS location 20 mins away.  This is the one I really want to work well.  Hybrid WFH/Office, out shopping, dining, etc.  Having temp dynamically adjust to my presence to use minimal energy will be my biggest efficiency gain.3. Alexa app needs an overhaul.  The Home screen constantly changes which menus are seen.  I haven't found a way to stop/prevent screen clutter from them pitching Popular Skills.4. This morning I woke up at 5 AM warmer than usual.  I look at the temp on the phone and it's 5 degrees higher than should be.  I checked config and all of the Home/Away/Sleep temps I configured defaulted to factory settings.5. Alexa Hunches asks for feedback to help it learn.  You can only say ""yes"" or ""no"" to a questions phrased like ""Did Hunches do this properly?"".  I don't know what to rate it.  If it's 3 AM and it sets my Sleep temp to what I want do I say ""Yes"" to help improve hunches?  Or, do I say ""No"" because it did it 5 hours late?  Not knowing the algorithm they use I'm assuming I could be making it dumber.PROS:1. Installation.  This was replacing a digital HoneyWell thermostat.  The wiring was 100% identical.  All I had to do is pull the old one off the wall and stick this in its place.  Launch app and setup was as easy as it gets.2. Convenience.  Even though hunches are a work-in-progress I really like being able to use Alexa voice or phone to input desired temps.  My house has one thermostat on main floor.  When I'm upstairs and want it cooler I don't have to make a trip down to adjust.  Using routines right now to set Sleep temp to 65 automatically.  Saving energy and money and I sleep better with exact temp I want.  I don't think I'd ever manually adjust the temp multiple times through the day.3. Price.  Amazon hit a price point I couldn't say ""no"" to.  With energy rebates it's potentially free.  I believe it would have paid for itself in short order without rebates though.NEUTRAL:1. If you use Alexa Hunches you can't use the thermostats schedule function.  Example: schedule it to set Sleep temp at 10 PM and Home temp at 6 AM.  There is a workaround though.  Just use Alexa routines instead of thermostat schedule.  I'm hoping this gets me best of both worlds when it eventually get my presence right and set Away temp.No regrets purchasing.  I'll come back and raise the rating if the Hunches start working in my favor."
5.0,Great product and value. Don't listen to the whiners.,"  This is an ""install and forget about it"" product. It sets a temp, it adjusts at bedtime and when you're not home, it does adjustments through Alexa when you ask. Simple. This is the Fire tablet of smart thermostats.If you've ever installed a thermostat, this is no different. If you have a 5-wire setup you're all set. If you can run a new wire you're good too. This is no different than any smart thermostat. People complaining about the installation or setup are being ridiculous. Google ""thermostat installation c wire"" and you can do this.The interface is super simple. The Alexa app features are simple and work, but the idea is your hardly ever have to muck with it. This is great if you just want  a comfortable home and save money and don't want to tinker constantly."
5.0,Too easy if you have an exsiting Honeywell thermostat!,  I have an existing non-wifi Honeywell thermostat.  I was happy to see that the wiring block and pins are identical between that and the Amazon thermostat.  No wiring needed.  Just popped off the old one and pushed on the new one!  The set-up on the app took longer than the physical installation!
2.0,More than one thermostat at the same house...Not good...Need Alexa team to upgrade software.,"  I have installed two units for my home. I love it. installation is easy and step by step instruction. It works with Amazon Alexa perfectly. The price is so good. You cannot find WIFI Thermostat like this. After installed it looks beautiful. I recommend it to you if you look for Wi-Fi smart thermostat. I set it with Alexa auto controlling, it makes easy to manage our home heating system. Alexa knows you are at home or not. And Alexa , she will adjust home temp automatically. Great product. I love it. However I have two installed, up stair and down stair, there is no way make schedule each one  individually. You set temp for the down stair as Alexa auto control prefer temp, Alexa will set the temp upstairs as the same as the down stair temp. I think Alexa team will fix this issue easily with software upgrade. Hope soon they will upgrade software."
5.0,"For the price, best smart thermostat","  I've owned Nest (eco and pricier models), Honeywell programmable, and quick stint with Ecobee.Install- as easy if not easier than all to install- *** DO a compatibility check before you order. *** It's free, easy, and it will save you lots of time and potentially money later.- follow the in app directions- It was installed in less than 20 mins- the final install is much cleaner than other brands* Take a picture of your current setup wiring now if you're considering a smart thermostat. Just reference the picture when doing a compatibility check *Programming- I didn't go with the ""hunch"" as I work from home and the is rarely away.- being used to Nest, the type of home, away, sleep is very similar. It took a minute or two to just figure out the copy/paste of the weekdays.Alexa- even though I'm an Android guy, I don't use Google home other than Nest protect and the former thermostat- I like to tell Alexa what to set the temp to (had to use it early one AM when I was up before my awake heat)- does not tell you humidity over Alexa; you'll have to check on the app- the Alexa app let's me check humidity, hours on during the day and estimate kWh used.- The app is a single point to check in on smart devices. You can create a favorites list on a fire tablet or your appAt this time there are no room sensors to create a primary temperature target. I like that with Ecobee and Nest.BUT for literally 1/2 the cost and a very very easy install, the Amazon smart thermostat will most likely gain significant market share quickly."
1.0,Won't accept Wi-Fi password,"  I know my Wi-Fi password. All my other Alexa devices accept my Wi-Fi password. I can easily log out and re-enter my Wi-Fi password on cellphones, laptops, desktops, Alexa devices. Yet this thing tells me ""Incorrect password"". Tech support wants to endlessly re-set, re-install Alexa app, etc. and try try try again. Same thing- ""incorrect password"".No way this is only happening to me..........Addition 11/16- Amazon customer service over 'chat' repeatedly had wrong instructions. Said 'Press ""Up + Mode' buttons at same time to re-set, when it turns out to be ""Up, DOWN + mode"" buttons at same time. Very frustrating especially when combined with Alexa app boots you back to square one every time there is any kind of delay. Still not working. Now connected with more knowledgeable customer service. But item is 'out of stock' so I cannot get a replacement. Meanwhile no heat or AC. Fingers crossed weather holds....."
1.0,"So bad, so limited, not worth cost.","  Does it work - yes.  Does it work good -  No, no, no1) The control interface is poor.  To turn on the fan while in automatic heat.mode, you have to cycle thru at least 5 button pushes to get to FAN ON.  Once in the fan only mode, the display does not show the fan on.  What product manager approved that.  Product Manager - you need to ask for help.2) No clock on display.  For some, that is a big miss.3) Temp control, there is no way to set +/- turn off set point such as, +1 deg turn on AC, -1 def turn off AC.  In heat mode, thermostat was short cycling to maintain exactly 70.  May be fixable.  Product Manager - Do you need help with simple stuff?4) App will at times not show the fan or heat on status.  Not acceptable for WiFi connect device.5). The App is an example or really lazy programming.  To change the mode in the app -  launch app, click devices, click thermostat, click settings, click mode.  No quick settings for phone.  Just bad interface.  Rushed to market is the best we can say.6) The thermostat will not track current run times.  The app will not track current run times.  A 20 year old Hunter thermostat will track run times for Today, Yesterday, The Week, and Last Week.  Are you sure you want to call this a Smart Thermostat.  Why does it matter?  By tracking run times you can see a problem with the ac running too long to cool the house.7) I called tech support .... Not in USA.  The lady kept asking ""Do you have Alexa"".  No help what so ever.  Zero stars.This product is missing basic functionality in 2021.  No, this is not worth the sale price"
2.0,Room for improvement - UPDATE 1/11/22,"  UPDATED REVIEWI have switched back to my old Ecobee smart thermostat. The Amazon thermostat is short cycling my HVAC system which could eventually cause excessive damage and higher energy bills; I don’t even have a complicated system.So I have to warn everyone that you cannot adjust the swing temp / set point of this thermostat. It will constantly cycle on/off as it tries to maintain your temperature; it won’t let your furnace “rest”. For example, in the morning the set temperature is 70, and due to our weather here in MI it can take up to an hour to reach that temp in the morning. As soon as the temperature is met, the thermostat will turn off the furnace, then turn it back on SECONDS later after it had been running for an hour. YOU WILL WEAR OUT YOUR HVAC SYSTEM with this behavior. The Ecobee in the same scenario will wait until the ambient temperature is 69.5 before it calls the heat again, and even on Ecobee the user can adjust the swing temp if they choose to do so.Also, as many have mentioned, the “Hunches” feature is hit and miss and not reliable enough to use. It won’t even recognize that I’ve left my house even though I have geofencing turned on. A ticket was placed into Amazon weeks ago for this issue and I’ve never heard back.I’ve waited for Amazon or Honeywell to address these issues but so far there have been no credible software updates since this thing launched. How disappointing.ORIGINAL REVIEWThis is a version 1.0 product and it shows. Hopefully Amazon will actively listen to customer feedback and make the following improvements:1. Allow Hunches and Schedules to work together2. Allow user to modify the temperature “swing” setting3. When using hunches, Alexa has only noticed I was “Away” once during my usage and should work accurately EVERY TIME being that I have geofencing turned on (this is something every other smart thermostat gets right out of the box).4. Illuminate the appropriate system icon (flame, snowflake etc) when system is running.5. Allow Alexa to state the humidity % if asked6. Let us set routines based on said humidity levelIf Amazon is quick to make these (software) changes; this device could definitely become best in class."
4.0,Ya basic. But that’s ok.,"  I was going to pass on this because it required a c-wire and I didn’t want to spend the extra money on an adapter. My old stat was connected with out a c-wire. But I decided to take a closer look at my cable- it did have a blue c-wire cut off. I connected to my old stat and made sure it was connected to the furnace. Once I finished my preparations, I preordered the new smart thermostat.I tried to research everything the thermostat could do. No previews anywhere. Oh well, I wait until I get it. Finally got it, installation and set up took less than 10 minutes. I went to see all of the features, and to tell the truth I was a little let down.First off there’s no instructions on how to use this. No little pamphlet in the box or even digital. I thought instructions would show me some hidden features. Nope. What you see is what you get. No outside temp display, no clock, not even a hold temp feature. I was strongly thinking of just returning this and getting a Nest at a discounted price. But after using it for a while, I changed my mind.I thought about the reasons I wanted a smart thermostat in the first place- to be able to control my thermostat from anywhere. In an ideal scenario, I wouldn’t have to ever look at the thermostat again. I didn’t need to be able the see the outside temp or time on the display. The plan white housing blends perfectly with my white walls (once I patch up the screw holes and touch up the paint).For those that already have a Nest, stick with your Nest. There is nothing new for you here. If you just want an inexpensive voice controlled thermostat, this is good product."
1.0,buy a NEST,"  Instructions ok but not thrilled about having to go into my HVAC system and mess with wires! ultimately had to hire an electrician, he could not make it work so I'm returning this. could not get it to work or have the alexa app recognize it. not worth the trouble and wasted $$ on the electrician (who said maybe I should have hired an AC guy). the QR code given did not link to anything!  3 of use wasted hours on this and its going back!!"
1.0,Short Cycling Setting,"  This thermostat does not currently have a basic compressor short cycling feature, which will prevent compressor in cooling mode from short cycling. This is a basic feature that most thermostats have. I am extremely surprised that Honeywell did not built this in to the settings of this thermostat.  This can easily be solved with a software update.  If not, I will be return mine with a thermostat that has this basic feature to prevent compressor failure from short cycling."
5.0,So far so good,"  Bought this to take better control of the temps in the house as we transition to fall. In GA it’s 37° in the am and 78° by mid afternoon…. I have wanted a smart thermostat and wanted to avoid the price tag. This unit is perfect for that. Setup and install couldn’t be easier and the Alexa app walks you through if you haven’t done this before. The app also can control the thermostat and set parameters. Truthfully, I walked over to take the pics and that’s the first time I’ve even looked at the thermostat itself in 4 days. The app control is very useful. I recommend allowing hunches too.Very much recommend and will buy more for the other 2 levels of the house.The unit can be installed without the trim plate but I didn’t want to hassle with touch up paint where the old unit was."
4.0,Good Value But a little Lacking On Tech Documentation,"  I just installed this tonight so I'll try to update this review in a couple months.  I have a standard heat pump with reversing valve & resistive heat strips for auxiliary heat.The physical install was easy and straitforward. When the tstat connects to your wifi, it downloads firmware updates as indicated by a blinking yellow exclamation point. This is not discussed in the provided documentation and you can't complete setup until the download completes. The wiring terminal block was pretty standard for hvac tstats. Note:-White (aux heat)- W2 not W.-Red (24V xfmr) - R not Rc.You must connect the other side of the 24V xfmr (Blue ""C"" wire) to the C terminal. All other connections are pretty standard."
1.0,DO NOT BUY - unsuitable for multi-adult households,"  WARNING - This product does NOT work with Amazon Household!What does this mean? Unlike every other smart thermostat, there is only *one* person in a household who can adjust the thermostat from their phone.Amazon has ""Amazon Household"" which allows you to invite other people to control your smart home devices - this is how Alexa devices and lights are managed currently - it works fine. Unfortunately, adding people onto this does not allow them to change or even see the Amazon Thermostation.This is a gross oversight that this device doesn't work with that setup.So what would another adult be able to do to adjust the thermostat?1) Log in with the primary person's Amazon account, which also gives them full access to everything, including purchases - not really optimal.2) Physically interact with the thermostat - which kind of defeats the purpose of having a smart thermostat.3) Interact with the thermostat using Alexa voice commandsThe *most obvious* thing to do with a smart thermostat is to control its settings with your phone. If you're lying in bed and want to make a temperature change, you can't do #2 or 3 without making noise.So by all means, exclude your spouse/roommate/partner from being able to control the thermostat or set the smart functions through their phone! If you'd like some more household strife, perhaps make the thermostat controllable only through a nice game of Monopoly?"
4.0,"Great value, interface on unit and app could be better","  This is the best value for a smart thermostat.My only complaint is that changing the fan setting is more difficult than it needs to be. To change the fan mode on the alexa app you have to dig into the thermostats settings menu. It's just as annoying on the unit itself because you only have one button to cycle between cool/heat modes as well as the fan mode, so you end up spamming the button until you come around to the option you want.You can't change the physical unit itself, but adding a button to specifically change the fan mode on the main temperature screen of the alexa app would be nice.The most convenient way to change the temperature is with alexa voice commands using for example, an echo speaker.Overall, it could be a little more convenient to adjust common settings/modes, but it does what it needs to do at a great price and future software updates to the app could could help with my complaints as well.I'm very happy with it and I love that it has the ""circulate fan"" feature which is a good balance between the typical ""auto"" and ""constant fan"" options that you're limited to on most thermostats."
5.0,"Easy Setup, works great","  I pre-ordered two of these for my dual zone heating/cooling system.  One zone is gas, the other electric.  I do not have a heat pump or other item that adds to the complexity of setup.  With that said, I didnt need to use the instructions for setup, it was very straight forward.Before getting the devices, I was a bit concerned that my previous thermostat was much larger and the new would not cover the old color of paint.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a ""base plate"" in the package that was a very similar size and fully covered the area of the old space.  I do wish there were two options for that baseplate however, one that is the same size as the thermostat itself...I think it would just look a bit better, but its not a big deal.Once I had them setup I went through the app for schedule/configuration etc.  Way more simple than setting a schedule on my old thermostat.  The ability to modify the temperature from my phone, or just by telling Alexa is pretty convenient and works perfectly.  So far I am incredibly happy with it."
5.0,Incredibly easy and intuitive to set up.,"  Installs and sets up in minutes. Has all of the smart features you could want, and at a fraction of the price of some other smart thermostats. A+"
1.0,Not ready for prime time.,"  It was easy to install.  The on device controls are pretty basic and confusing.  The voice controls suck, I can't override my current temps via voice.  Documentation is lacking for physical device and Alexa control.If you want to give all control to Alexa to let that assume your comfort level.  But if you want to schedule a temp schedule, be prepared for Alexa to be smarter than you.  Her ""hunches"" will always trump your actual scheduled temps, and voice control will say ""I'm sorry I can't do that right now"", or ""I'm sorry thermostat can't be set to that.It is a some what good effort, I am just glad I didn't pay more that $60 for this thermostat.  I will most likely be replacing with my old school Honeywell that does what it is told instead of what it would like to do.If you are happy with Amazon's AI determining what your temp is, or you want to give up you comfort to the whims of Amazon's AI then this is the thermostat for you.Personally I want to schedule out my temps, I know what my house does for temp swings, and I set my schedule according.  I would like a setting that says, do this and damn your AI, allow me to control my house the way I want not they way you think it should be.I had high hopes that this would be a good product, but I am ready to rip it out and go to an old school mercury thermostat that does what I want instead of what it wants."
4.0,Sleek and Easy to install!,
2.0,I have a 'hunch' Alexa has no idea what she is doing,"  Installation was a simple breeze on this device.  Alexa immediately found her and gave me access to all the settings through the Alexa App.  Initially I decided to use Alexa 'Hunches' to control the thermostat automatically based on whatever she thinks about us.  The 3 choices to choose from are Home, Away, Sleep.  That's it.  You can select a temp for each of the three and then let Alexa try to decide which of the 3 she believes is happening.  After about a week of complete non-sense hunches being made, I gave up on that feature.  She was consistently saying we were going to sleep at 11:46pm each night when we had been going to bed around 9:30 each night.  Clearly her hunches are made up since her hunch each night was exactly the same time no matter how many times I told her in the app that her hunches were wrong.  We have MANY Dots around the house so if she is listening, she is failing.  I found myself manually asking Alexa to lower my temp to my sleep temp from bed via voice each night.  Then I went on vacation and enabled the feature that could track your phone to make decisions about if you should be in Away mode.  Each day I would log into my Alexa app and found she was just going ahead and heating the whole house even though I kept having to override her back.  To solve this problem I just lowered the max heating temp to my away temp and that allowed her to stop making dumb decisions.Once I returned home from vacation I ditched the Hunch feature and went to a schedule feature.  These features are mutually exclusive (makes some sense).  The daily schedule feature only allows 4 setpoints and times throughout the day and each day can have their own up to 4 temps/times.  4 is not enough for me and my 10 year old dumb Honeywell thermostat allows up to 8 per day even.  (I like to heat the house when my wife is getting ready for work and then again when I am getting ready for work 1.5 hours later in addition to having the house heat up when either of our schedules are having us come home and then drop back down for bedtime).The schedule feature was equally broken.  I consistently found the thermostat heating to a temp that was no where in the schedule.  I had it set to start heating at 5:15am for my wife and it never did it without her hitting the up button.  I played with the 'preheat' toggle and that didn't appear to do anything.  Each night it was supposed to drop to the sleep temp at 9:30 but I found it cooking us away at 10:30 many times.Couldn't trust this device to do a single thing it was intended to do aside from wifi/voice control and remote administration.  Definitely not worth the money since it couldn't seem to tell time."
1.0,Disappointing.  Could and should be better,"  12/3/2021 UPDATE  The unit is practically useless.  It cannot handle basic commands to turn on or off.  The response from Alexa is ""more than one device share that name, which one would you like..."" But NO other device has a remotely similar name, so I can't do anything on my end. Amazon ""tech support"" are incapable of solving this issue and refered me to the manufacturer, because Amazon can't resolve ""wiring issues"".  To be fair, this ceased being an issue for a few days, but then returned absent any changes on my end.  Not sure if it's been resolved because now Alexa tells me the device ""does not support that function.""  Wonderful, a ""smart"" device that is incapable of basic commands to turn on or off.Original review: I purchased two of these after Hive stopped USA support. I was fairly happy with the Hive units but experienced occational issues, mostly with communication between Alexa and the Hive units.  I was optomistic these, being an Amazon product, would communicate better with Alexa and would be an improvement.  Amazingy, they are not.  One of the units controls the first floor heat pump, the other controls the second floor heat pump.  I've named the units ""first floor"" and ""second floor"".  Asking Alexa to decrease 2nd floor will sometimes work but sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes Alexa responds asking which first floor I am refering to, claiming other devices have the same name.  But no other devices in our home have a remotely similar name.  The second dumfounding bit of stupididty I""ve encouncounted is, if I win the temp change lottery, Alexa responds by reciting my prefered tempature range e.g. this device is set to keep temps between 60 and 68.  Apparently a programmer thought this was helpful.  With the Hive unit Alexa used to advise the new actual temperature setting e.g. 1st floor is now set to 68.  Time will tell if updates include some common sense and make these more useful."
2.0,Schedule Limitations,"  TLDR: Schedule is limited to 4 actions per day. Routines and schedule do not allow you to set the thermostat mode. Despite this, you can tell Alexa to do everything the routines don't let you do. Why? It looks nice though.I was worried by pre-ordering this I'd hate it. Turns out I'm mostly right. Installed it and then I went to set the schedule. Oh boy... I can't understand why Amazon is limiting me to only 4 ""mode"" changes per day and that these MUST be done in the schedule section of the thermostat. I base my life around routines. Routines that even Honeywell's cheap schedule based thermostats allow you to set. Those modes by the way expect you to be in automatic mode.Now here's the hilarious part. You could setup Google Home on a schedule to say ""Alexa, set Thermostat to heat."" then ""Alexa, set thermostat to 72."" That's how you must setup custom routines. The company the brought us routines to setup our lives now won't let you setup a routine.Why must Amazon limit my ability to set the thermostat up how I want?Why must I be limited to 4 max mode changes?Why must these mode changes be exclusively in automatic mode?Why can't a smart thermostat allow me to set my own schedule?Just get a Emerson Sensi ST55. It allows you all the freedom you'd expect from a smart thermostat. It does everything this thermostat does and more for $80. I have 2 ST55s in storage but decided to try something new and exciting from Amazon instead of digging them out after my move. As soon as I find those thermostats I'm ewasting this one. I don't want anyone else to be as frustrated as I am."
1.0,Frustrating waste of time,"  I have a brand new Slant Fin boiler that was installed this summer. Boilers are 2 wire systems without a C wire. Knowing this, I installed a 24v transformer to power the Amazon thermostat. Used Rc and C to power it, R and W went to the boiler. Powered right up. Went through all the various selection screens,  select wires, select boiler etc. Connected to my mesh system just fine. Last screen was to connect to Alexa. Tried approximately 6 times, no joy.  Texted support. Their pearls of wisdom was to unplug the thermostat and try again, and to delete and reinstall the Alexa app. Wasted an entire afternoon on this piece of crap. Sending it back.Update:Installed a HoneywellHome smart thermostat today with the exact same wiring that didn't work with the Alexa thermostat. Even connected it to Alexa and had her control the Honeywell thermostat. So either I got a bum Alexa thermostat or it doesn't work with a boiler and a separate power supply.Update #2I installed a new Amazon smart thermostat at my son's house today. Went well, took 2hrs including the time it took to run new 5 conductor wire with a blue ""C"" wire to replace the 4 conductor R, W, Y, G wire. Two things, it had him connected his phone by Bluetooth to the thermostat. I don't remember having to do that. He has a furnace, I have a boiler. I still think these don't work on boilers."
1.0,Garbage!,"  The single worst thermostat ever designed!  The ONLY way to configure and setup the thing is to use Alexa, only via on your phone!  In my case, I hired a tech and PAID him to come out and help set this thing up.  Well, as the only way to connect is via the Alexa app, guess what?The thing would not connect to my network.  This  behavior despite numerous other Amazon devices connecting to my network just fine.  And, as there is no manual way to configure this thing up, I was dead in the water.Here's the real issue:  Amazon through its manufacturer purchased the cheapest Wireless Ethernet chip they could get.  The end result is that it may connect to some, but not to others' networks.  If you are one of the ones that this piece of crap wireless chip doesn't connect to, you ARE screwed!I then spent over TWO HOURS on the phone with tech support to no avail whatsoever.  Nothing worked!  I had to reboot my router (which I really don't appreciate!) and that did nothing.  Reconnecting the old thermostat was not possible as my tech left and I had a very cold night.  I saved nothing buying this crummy thermostat, and will end up paying much more than if I had bought a more reputable brand in the first place.Come on, Amazon, spend some money on a good Wireless chip for this device!"
5.0,"Bargain ""smart"" thermostat. Barebones, elegant and works. Nothing compares.","  I have had two of these since the day they were released. Preordered after first hearing about them and was excited for the features, direct connectivity with the Alexa environment and of course, the price.Simple to install (disclaimer- I am an engineer and know HVAC systems) and I only had to make one small wiring change to my existing HVAC system. Hooking up a thermostat is not always as simple as moving some wires - you actually need to understand what those wires do and your original system might not be quite ""standard."" In my case, there were some ""extra"" wires hooked up to the old Honeywell smart thermostats that were in the house when we bought it.Amazon and Honeywell have made a valiant attempt to consumer-proof this item but it is still a bit tricky to get working. Multiple configurations and settings have been integrated in to the ""which wires are connected"" wizard in the app and Amazon could do a little better on offering compatibility information before the purchase. I will say this, I have had absolutely dismal experience with Honeywell smart devices and am thankful that the Amazon layer is in place between them and Hw. That said, it's a new item and Amazon is assuredly still learning and developing their support for it.I am a bit frustrated with manual control on the device. It's a bit confusing what you might be changing when you press the circle and then start pressing the up/down arrows. I keep turning the fan mode from ""auto"" to ""on"" at the device. Easy to set in the Alexa app but not intuitive on the wall. Voice commands work OK. We just use ""set the temperature"" and as long as we remember to say ""upstairs or downstairs thermostat"" is all works fine. In auto-changeover mode (heat and cool set to automatically switch) the voice command is a bit tricky and Alexa likes to argue with us about it. I generally just use the app though. We're not much for ""schedules"" with our HVAC and generally run the systems manually in this new ""we're-always-at-home world.""Definitely like the units. Best price-point and simple design win. And it works. None of the complex front panel features of the $300 competitors do anything for me and in this world of integrated design, paying more than $100 for a thermostat (literally $15 of parts!!!) is just dumb. Lots of manufactures price-gouging naïve customers out there..."
4.0,"Great Price, But Updates Needed","  So I own many Alexa devices and for the price on this thermostat, especially since I needed two, I was willing to take the chance it might not quite be ready for prime time. Now my house is newer and didn't have any issue with the C wire, etc., and I had the luxury of already having Honeywell thermostats as well. So that made my replacements very easy, as I only had to pop off the existing head unit and click the new on. That was it!  However, not sure if Amazon was having some server issues, but the only problem I ran into was connecting the thermostat(s) to Alexa/my network. That took some different turns, failures, errors, etc., to which I did see a message at some points that said server unresponsive. So that might have been what the issue was there. Anyway, I had to jump on a call for 15 mins and came back to try running through the setup again.. boom, worked like a charm.Now the interface within the Alexa App for the thermostat is a bit slow, but I assume they will improve that performance in short order.  On the app settings, it is strange to me that there are only 3 temp mode settings, which are Home, Away and Sleep. With other thermostats I owned, you could set up more than that, which was nice. I prefer to have a wake mode, away mode, Home mode and sleep mode, which allowed me to have unique temps. You do have 4 total event changes you can setup a day, but with only 3 temp modes, I can't use 4 unique temp change events that I like to have. However, I assume Amazon will continue to upgrade the software as this product ramps up and bring in more settings. Additionally, it was nice with another thermostat I used, where you had a hold mode, which offered you a quick way to jump into the app and click a button to hold temps at a more aggressive lower/higher designated degree while you were gone for a weekend or more. You can't really use the ""Away"", because you need all three temp modes for your normal usage and as of right now, there is no hold mode on the app.All in all, this budget thermostat is well worth the money and I am sure Amazon will continue to drop updates, making this better and better. I was an early adopter of Alexa and those products/software are light years better than those days. So looking forward to seeing a few more optimization and advancements to this product over time, but a solid offering at an awesome price point."
5.0,Simple Setup and Seamless Integration,"  Purchased three of these to replace three existing older model honewell thermostats that controlled one A/C unit, one furnace, and two heat pumps. Installation was easy, just follow the directions SLOWLY. I highly recommend purchasing a voltage tester if you're doing this on your own to make sure you don't shock yourself during installation.Once issue I ran into because I was rushing through the installation process on the third thermostat controlling one of the heat pumps was that I mistakenly told the system that it was pumping out cool air when in reality I hadn't given it a chance to heat up. This caused the system to think (I believe) that I installed the wiring incorrectly and adjusted itself which caused the heating mode to use the AC instead of the heat.I fixed this by going into the settings for the thermostat in question, clicking on ""Thermostat configuration"" and selecting ""HVAC Type."" Once there I took a look at the configuration of the unit by clicking on ""Reversing valve"" and notcing ""B (O/B on Heat)"" was selected when the originaly setup used the ""O"" wire. To change this configuration I selected ""O (O/B on Cool)"" and then went to the thermostat and held the ""o"" button, as prompted by the app, in order to implement this change. Once I held the button and waited for the countdown on the thermostat to finish, the system reconfigured itself and hot air began to blow again when heat was on.Hopefully this mishap and troubleshooting will help others who rush through the setup process and mistakenly tell the system that the air blowing out of your vents is cool when in reality it is just taking some time to heat up.One way Amazon may be able to help mitigate this issue would be to encourage those setting up the device to WAIT at least 2-3 minutes until you can select whether cold or hot air is blowing from the vents.Overall I am very happy with the products' functionality and appearance, and especially am a big fan of the seamless integration with all of other smart home devices I have connected through Alexa."
3.0,Cold & Heat Reversed (Initially),"  I have a heat pump and wired the thermostat based on the instructions in the app. When we turned it on after wiring, connection to internet and the app was fine but noticed that it was heating when it should have been cooling. Double checked all of the wiring and everything looked fine. Looked on the internet and there were suggestions for the Nest thermostat, but all of the research seemed to indicate my wiring was correct. After speaking with Amazon support and resetting the thermostat, they finally referred me to the Resideo support. Called them and after an hour on the phone, we realized it was a setting in the app. Under the thermostat configuration > HVAC type, I had to select “Reversing valve” and change it to “B (O/B on heat)”. Once I did that, it started working properly. App is OK but I think it could use some improvement."
5.0,Very Pleased,"  I installed the Amazon thermostat this afternoon. Relatively easy install as long as you keep in mind how many HVAC systems there are and the possible wiring combinations. The install works If you have done the preparation of checking your wiring and thinking through the instructions. I had no problems until a glitch connecting to the internet. It was an issue with my wifi6 router. After thinking that through, everything connected and we are all set up. I recommend that those who have problems think about the problem before throwing a hissy fit. This is not a $250 thermostat. You've got to work with what you've got and think it out. It's not perfect but for the price point and it's basic functionality, this is pretty damn good!"
3.0,"Mostly good start, then it just goes to mediocre","  Installation was MOSTLY easy. Just as I was starting the connection from the app, the app crashed. When I got it back up, then my internet happened to have an outage for 4 hours (obviously not the greatly of Amazon ..I hope).I set a schedule and seemed to go week for a week...until I tried some manual changes. If I raised the temperature, either through the app or the thermostat directly, within a few minutes, it just reverts back to the scheduled temp. There doesn't seem to be a place to set a timer for the temporary change -and if there is, the app is a HORRIBLE place to get around in to find anything!The app is RIDICULOUS!I'm taking this down and going to switch to either a Nest or Wyze thermostat.I actually thought this would work well coming from Amazon."
4.0,If you have an electric heatpump READ THIS!,"  So the install ""wizard"" isn't perfect or even polished at this point.  I've installed wifi thermostats before, Honeywell makes this one so I figured it would be easy enough since I've done those before.  The first mistake was thinking that Amazon would have their act together on this.  Not the case...IF YOU HAVE AN ELECTRIC HEATPUMP SYSTEM IMPORTANT INFO!  In my case my 2010 era Carrier system had one specific wire that caused me an issue:  W/White with no other identification.  I knew this was heat but was unsure do I hook it up to W?  W2?  The install wizard asked me for what wires I had, and then completely NEGLECTED to indicate hooking up ""W"" at all!  The guided wizard would be amazing if it actually worked... if you pause to long during the process there is no ""resume"" and you start over from scratch which is annoying.Called Amazon support, and discussed the W/W2 situation with them, they of course can't help with wires but did give me a 1-800 number to call for Honeywell/Resideo.  They were very helpful and indicated because it was a heatpump system, use W2(aux) - they mentioned the ""gray"" labelled alphabet on the wire hookup guide was for a standard/classic system and thus because I had a heatpump which is ""nonstandard"" and W was part of the ""gray standard wires"" that is the logic to use W2(aux) instead.  Great info, now why could I not find that in any documentation?So Amazon, fix the wizard so you provide additional resources if the wires the customer indicates they have do not match up with your database, the fact they just ignored a whole wire when they asked for that specific information directly was big red flag on how rushed this product really is.  Also, if you run through setup and during diagnostics they have an issue and say ""call us"" you are exited from the wizard and have to completely reset the thermostat from scratch and start at step 1.  Basically my time spent to install was simply fighting with the wizard and one simple question that I couldn't get answered easily.  Hindsight is to just pretend you are installing a Honeywell instead and look up a real install guide!Overall it seems to work fine, I like the option for the fan to be ON/AUTO/CIRCULATE as I love the intermittent circulation option.  I dislike the fact there is no voice command to change this setting.Best part is its a CHEAP thermostat that looks good, and while its no NEST its a better looking Honeywell with Amazon smarts to help learn your patterns so we'll see how it goes!"
5.0,Literally setup in 10 minutes!,"  Well my pre-ordered Thermostat arrived today exactly on time. Opened the box and followed the instructions and boom! 10 minutes setup and running like a champ. I have quite a few other Alexa devices and I have to say this was probably one of the easiest to setup. Granted I am a bit of a DIY’er and understand a little electrical, but really as long as you can plug wires into a connector and hang a picture you can install this thing. Honestly, I was a bit apprehensive since most of these devices (the good ones anyway) are much more expensive. I’m so glad Amazon can offer a great product at a great price. Ahh now to sit back and let the thermostat set the temp without having to think about it."
3.0,"Seems like it was rushed to market, not yet fully featured","  I was excited to get one of these thermostats, but have been disappointed in its use.The installation instructions were completely missing a step and also left out some helpful/essential details.  That was frustrating (but not as frustrating as the help from Amazon support.....).When I finally got the unit installed and operating, there were a number of surprised, none of them good.  For example, there's no way to use Alexa to turn the thermostat completely off, or to turn it on if it is already off.  This can be done through the Alexa app, so why can't it be done via voice command, too?Another disappointment - the minimum temperature you can set it to is 50°F (10°C).  Why not lower?  Amazon support agents obfuscated and offered fantasy excuses, but there's no underlying reason why this limit was set.  This is supposed to be an ""energy saving"" thermostat, but the coolest you can have your house (eg, if you're out of town for a week) is 50°?  That's crazy.  My older thermostat went down to at least 40°.Another disappointment.  The device measures humidity as well as temperature, but you can't use an Alexa command to be told what it is.  It shows the humidity in the Alexa app, so why can't it tell you, too?Another disappointment.  You can't set, by voice, a future time to raise or lower the temperature.And don't get me started on ""hunches"".  Alexa guessed wrong every time with its hunches for what to do with the temperature, but I did discover one kinda spooky thing.  Alexa knows when I go to the toilet!  I went to the toilet in the middle of the night - didn't turn any lights on, didn't touch my phone, just tiptoed to the bathroom, did what needed to be done, and returned back to the bedroom.  But Alexa somehow had a hunch that someone was up, and so turned the temperature up to full daytime temperature.  I can only guess it was listening to the sounds from the bathroom.  Yuck.Some other Alexa commands are greeted with a response ""That has not been implemented yet"" which suggests there is an ongoing development path for the device.  But a shame that more hadn't been implemented prior to its release."
1.0,Awesome but missing main thing read below,"  This is missing the heat indicator a little red flame icon when heat is on.  it is present on device but not on when heat is on, how ridiculous how could you create something so awesome and forget like the most important thing??? I have to open alexa app this dumb also it opens on home then you have to go to devices page and then it shows up as a favorite put this on home screen so easy to get to. At least app shows heating is on in red letters.  I got say again  how ridiculous does anyone even test these products before selling them.  See pictures one of thermostat with heat on no way to know, other of the app page and you can see the word heating.  The thermostat has this icon because when you change temperature it comes on for a few seconds,  do a firmware or software upgrade get this fixed or I am sending it back as I hope every single person who has bought one until fixed. So I am giving 1 star fix it you will get for sure a 4 star or 5 star from me, only had this a few days but it has great potential and change app Alexa so thermostat is more easily accessible.  I will add then if you touch thermostat it lights up arrow keys and the heat indicator also as well as when changing setting it lights the little red flame icon. But still show the little red heat when heat is on I don't have cooling but assuming it is the same. Who tests these products,  wake up man your missing it. I want to buy more of these but not going to until fixed and if not soon I will send back and get a competitor product. Again. Ridiculous to ha e to touch the face of this thermostat in certain spot to see if heat is (little red flame) please do call me and I will explain if you don't understand I update my phone number thanks.Additional stupid: can't set temperature below 50 degrees so this rules out using in my garage, please fix this asap. Like at least 40 degrees. On above little red flame at least make this an option to show if heat is on."
5.0,you must know what system you have before starting.,"  First, know your existing system, furnace, heat pump, etc.Take pictures of your existing wiring and carefully follow instructions. I am 73 and not a tech guru. I got it to work. I had a wire in the wrong place but a quick call to the tech resolved that in minutes. She patiently guided me through the resetting and now it works like a charm.I do not see the basis for negative reviews, if I could do it, anyone can.It also looks good."
1.0,Never made it past PROVISIONING FAILURE,"  The physical installation was easy. Unfortunately the connection to the app was a total dead end. I got to the part where you select the wifi network that you want to connect to. I selected our normal wifi that everything else is connected to and it thinks for about a minute before displaying:Provisioning FailureSorry, an issue occurred during device setup. Please try again. (3.14.0.3).I spent about 2 hours with tech support who did not even know what the item was or did. They kept transferring me to ""specialist"" after ""specialist"" who would ask me the same questions before deciding I needed a different ""specialist"" that deals with this item. The final person I spoke with asked me if it responded when I said ""Alexa"" and seemed very confused when I told him that a thermostat doesn't have a speaker to talk back to me.I rebooted, I deleted and reinstalled, I cycled modems and routers, I updated software on everything, I manually entered my wifi, I soft reset, I factory reset, I must have tried at least 200 times to get it to work, but nothing. Every single time I get the same Provisioning Failure message and no one at amazon can help me fix it.I figured, must be a defective unit so...I ordered another one. THE SAME EXACT PROBLEM. I cannot believe that Amazon is putting their name on this awful product. I am grateful for Amazon's return policy."
4.0,Fantastic value for the price. Some hiccups need to be ironed out in future models.,"  There is no better value smart thermostat on the market. Even being lighter on complex features than some, the price gap is so huge, what you get for the price still blows all the ""big name"" smart thermostats out of the water.I also love the brightness adjustment, especially being able to turn it all the way off. My ""inactive"" setting is 0 just because the sleek/clean/blank look is nice and keeps it from being a focal point.Pros:-VERY easy install and if you have very little to no experience with wiring a thermostat, the Alexa app walkthrough is super thorough. The actual panel unit where wires attach is much cleaner and easier than the old clunky screw block style.-Sleek design. Someday I'll fill old holes and paint the wall so I can remove the beauty plate, but even as-is it looks great.-Straight forward to use in the Alexa app but still has all the manual on-unit controls you'd be used to on a standard thermostat.-PRICE. Again, for $80 I don't think you can get a better thermostat.Cons:-Software is a bit glitchy in my experience so far. Ex: Within the schedule If I adjust the desired temperature for ""Heat: Active at Home"", it auto-adjusts the same field under ""Cool"" settings. I don't want that. If I set my ""At Home"" heater setting to 71 and my ""At Home"" AC setting to 73, I expect those to persist. When I switch the heat setting say from 71 to 73, my ac setting(separate setting all together, unrelated in the app) will mysteriously go from 73 to 70 or some other weird adjustment as if those 2 numbers can never be the same. It doesn't make sense.-Limited customizability on schedule setting. You get 4 settings and you cannot rename them. ""Home"", ""Active Home"", ""Away"", ""Sleep"". Working from home, those titles aren't 100% perfect and some days I need at least 1 additional setting. Other than programming things in a very basic and minimalist way to get the product out quickly, I can't think of a reason. What I name my settings and how many I use in a day wouldn't impact anything and should absolutely be part of the software.Overall, any  downsides are well within the threshold of my acceptance for the price. If a $250 Nest had those issues, I'd be emailing their support or returning it. For $80, this thing performs WELL above it's price point so I can't complain about the little details!"
4.0,Some hassle but now it's working,"  This thermostat was easy and straight forward to install. I have an older home so I had to also install the c wire adapter. No problems there.It seems to be working well now and is pretty consistent, but it took some fiddling. Originally, it would turn the heat down to my preferred away temp when I left the house, even when my wife was still home. I tried setting our home location on her Alexa app and turned on permissions but no luck. I chatted with three different people in the app and was told that it only responds to one person, the one on the Amazon account. Since my wife and I share an account, it wouldn't work correctly. I thought that was really dumb, so I left a one star review. Within a couple days I started getting phone calls and emails from Amazon about my review. Apparently, they don't want any bad reviews. Anyway, they told me to set my wife's home location and turn on liston permissions (like I had already done). They must have changed something because it is now working.  The heat only goes down when both of us leave.I like how is working now but I took off a star for the trouble."
1.0,Pretty useless without the app-updated,"  OK, the headline might not make sense to you.  After all, this is intended to be an IoT device, why complain about controlling it from the device itself?  The reason is using the app or an Echo device to control this is sometimes inconvenient since you have to issue 3 commands; (1) turn on the thermostat (2) set the mode and (3) set the temperature.  Alexa freaks out if you combine these.  Cumbersome if you just came home and want to turn on the heat.  Yes, I know there are front panel controls on the thermostat.  Problem is they just don't work most of the time for me.  Forget about the idea of learning your habits.  You will get heating or cooling when you don't want it and have the fan only running at other times.I also don't like the idea that this does not play well with Google Home.My suggestion is to take a pass on this and try one of the other alternatives.Update--I've given up on this thermostat and will install the old one tomorrow.  The Amazon ""Smart"" thermostat keeps changing the temperature (though Alexa hunches are supposed to be off) or deciding that the fan should run constantly.  I've dropped the review to one star.  Can you give zero???"
5.0,Works great for 3-zone hydronic baseboard heaters,"  I pre-ordered three of these for my 3-zone hydronic heating system and so far they work great.  It was easy to install and set up, the only finicky bit was ganging and running the three c-wires to the single com terminal on my taco control board.  So far I have only used the hunch function for setting/changing temperatures, not schedule, but it seems i can set different temperatures for each zone, for home, away, and sleep.  For $60 each these together cost less than a single comparable Nest ... a great value, especially if you're already invested in the Echo ecosystem!My main complaint is that I have to dig through the Alexa app to get to control these, as opposed to having a dedicated dashboard, but that's not even enough to take off a star.  Will try to update if my experience changes."
4.0,Very basic 1st Generation Amazon Smart Thermostat,"  Read all the reviews as many cover the short commings of this thermostat.Does it work as advertised?  Yes.  It does what it promises but it could be so much more powerful.Pros:1.  Tasteful design.  I do like that it blends right into the wall and isnt visually calling attention to itself.  In a narrow hallway, you will likely walk right past it on a day-to-day basis.  Perfect.2.  Integrates perfectly with Alexa.  Getting Alexa to discover the thermostat was bullet proof.Cons:1.  Installation instructions are horrible.  The reliance upon a phone app to install is the wrong approach especially if you want to hand the job over to a 3rd party HVAC company.  If you are lucky enough to have wiring that is ready to go, you can do the installation yourself.  I really dont believe that everyone fits into that category and having the instructions available fully printed for a HVAC tech would not have been difficult.  Also, the wiring wizard was nice but should also have been available from a website for a HVAC tech.  The wiring wizard also was buggy in that there were optional wiring choices that were on separate UI panels and moving back and forth on the panels unchecked choices.  It was a mess.  The QR code was printed on the manual which can easily be thrown away which is undoubtedly going to happen.  The QR code sticker should also be on the backplate so it can never be lost.2.  Alexa voice control is underwhelming.  If Alexa already knows the daily weather forcast, I would expect a lot more 'smarts' about advising what to do next for scheduling.  I am not interested in the hunch feature.  It should be saying, 'I've noticed the forecast is calling for freezing temperatures.  Would you like to adjust your thermostat?'  Nope. Just dumb old Alexa complaining she doesnt understand or cant because I have selected an automatic range.  The Alexa app is devoid of statistics.  I want to see efficiency charts.  Nope.3.  Local rebates are non existent for where I live.  Be sure to check in advance if you are expecting a rebate of any kind.Would I purchase this again if I had to do it over?  YesWould I recommend this to someone?  Depends.  If they must replace an older thermostat, sure.  If they have a working semi-smart thermostat, no.  There isnt much value here and its impossible to say if you are saving money in the long run."
1.0,Broken software. Alexa doesn’t work. Fails at main function.,"  Have an Ecobee in one house. Installed this in another since it was cheaper. Has already cost me money in wasted fuel.Install was ok. Instructions were adequate. Didn’t like the wire harness. Extremely tight fit for old work and it was very hard to stuff wires into the wall, unit, and location to cover the old thermostat holes with the plate.The software is broken!!! Completely broken! I had several failures.Schedule mode. Can’t add, delete, or remove times and temperatures. It simply forgets, sets it’s own or resets to an random other temp. Alexa and the unit don’t sync settings properly. Completely useless.Alexa mode. The hunches worked fine the first day when home. Was away a couple days. Decided that it needed to set my heat to 78 at 4:52 AM since it hunched someone was home. Why? Wrong! Complete failure. Propane is massively expensive. Super angry. Max temp setting was 74.Doesn’t respect the temperature limits. Resets them on its own.Lowest heat temperature is 50. Why?Wish I would have bought another Ecobee."
2.0,Kinda disappointed. Not easy to control device without talking to Alexa.,"  All we need is a thermostat you can easily control with your smartphone or computer.We primarily use Google Home, but Im not a fan of Nest devices and they are a bit pricey. I figured this Amazon thermostat was inexpensive and had the features we needed. However, Amazon really only built this thing for people who like to talk to Alexa.1) Device does not work with Google Home. -- Kinda a jerk move from Amazon considering Nest devices are supported on Alexa, but whatever. I knew this when I bought it.2) You can't control via the web. -- This is annoying as it limits your ability to control the thermostat on many devices. You cant even control from alexa.amazon.com3) Controlling the thermostat from the Alexa App is a huge pain. The app is complex, loads slowly, and takes 4-5 clicks before you reach the thermostat to change the temperature. I also, cant find a way to share the thermostat with family members so I just have them all logged into my Amazon Alex app.In an idea situation the thermostat would function like this:- Save a deep link directly to your thermostat controls. One click opens controls and you can change temp.- Make a widget that allows you to change temperature without opening an app.- Allow control of the temperature from a web interface with deep linking enabled."
5.0,So far so good,"  I went from an original nest to the Amazon smart thermostat.  My nest was still working but it wasn’t connecting well with my echo devices, something since a google change that I didn’t want to deal with anymore.  Being in a cold state and with winter coming, I wanted to replace the six year old device also, so timing was perfect.$60 for this thermostat is a great deal.  It has a nice neutral look and is subtle, something I really love.  The buttons can be a little difficult to see, but we don’t change the thermostat often once programmed so that should be a small concern over time.  We also can adjust by using Alexa, which adds more convenience for that.It’s a little early to comment on its ability to handle smart schedule, but it seems like we are off to a good start.  I don’t like complex schedules, and someone is always home so every day will be pretty identical.  If you’re aiming for simple like us, this is a good route to go.Installation wasn’t hard.  I took pictures of the old set up and just went through the Alexa walk through step by step.  Select your wires or take a picture, it makes it easy to do everything after that.  I recommend not attaching to the wall, it makes setting the wires easier, attach after they’re in place.I spent about ten minutes on installing the device, half of that waiting for the connection to set up and choosing if I wanted the back plate or not.  It ran through a few diagnostics and confirmations then we were set.Overall, I’m happy.  It’s too early to give a definitive response on that now, but I’ll update if anything changes."
1.0,Extremely disappointed. It is not a thermostat,"  I am an Amazon product fan and own Alexa’s, Fire products. I was excited about this thermostat since announcement and purchased right away.However i must say this is the first worst product I ever saw from Amazon product range.It is not a thermostat, it’s just a replica toy. It gives user all satisfaction to change and adjust temperatures, create schedule and all AI stuff.But it never adjusts AC for that. My furnace was running almost 24 hours when set between 69-72 F in Auto mode So Room maintained over 80 degrees all the time. I am worried for my energy bill and life of my HVAC due to thisScreen turns off automatically and never comes back to life. So literally I have to unplug it and plug backAlexa app doesn’t respond immediately and 3 out of 5 times doesn’t even open. Once opens it gives error that thermostat is offlineI had to literally turn off thermostat in night to prevent roasting us and killing my HVACDuring winter I would manually turn on and run my air conditioner to cool the house 4-5 times because this thermostat keeps running heat.Basically I manually adjusted temperature 4-5 times a dayChecked all wiring and connections and everything is ok.I finally decided to replace it with ecobee and paid twice the price. But right away after I replaced it my house temperature is normal. It’s perfect now.My recommendation: don’t buy for now. May be in few months when Amazon fixes all issues perhaps you may want to try.I still trust Amazon if they can send rockets to space, they will fix this too 😀"
2.0,"Hunches don't work, Schedule is off by a random number of hours, and it only connects to one phone.","  This is not our first 'smart' thermostat. Install was not difficult, but if you have any kind of special cases and get out of sequence with the step-by-step instructions, it will not allow you to complete the setup. It's a git too rigid.Once installed we came up against a few issues, and I will list them all in the order they were discovered.Singe phone/account only.My wife and I share an Amazon account, but it is not the same account it's a family connection between our two accounts. But when I try to add the thermostat to her phone, it wants to install it all over again. there is no way for us both to control the thermostat. This seems a little short-sighted.HunchesOne of the things I loved about the description of this thermostat was that Alexa would guess when you were going to bed, or leaving the house. But again, one of the main ways it would know you were leaving the house was by the location of your phone. That said, this will only work for a single person since it only recognizes one phone. Based on motion etc, it did OK at might mostly (although some nights it took 4 hours to realize we had gone to bed) but as to leaving the house, it almost never changed on its own.ScheduleNext, we went to set up a schedule. We have had scheduled thermostats for 30 years - analog first, then digital. I would set up a schedule and nothing would happen, then at completely random times, it would change the temperature. I had read a review somewhere, though I could not find it again, that the thermostat was apparently programmed to the wrong time zone. I first tried to 'trick' it by using Pacific time (we live in the east.) That didn't work. I'm now in the process of trial and error to figure out what time zone it is set for. You can only set it in increments of 15 minutes, so it takes hours to do by trial and error to figure out what time zone might be right. There is no way to see what time the device thinks it is, but the Alexa app where you're creating the schedule should know the time anyway. It turns our smart plugs on and off on intricate schedules all the time, so I don't understand why this does not work the same way.There are still three ways to set the temperature that work every time.Voice commandsManual temp change on the one connected phonePushing the buttons on the device itself.The only problem with these is you have to remember to do them. If you leave the house and forget that you didn't turn down the heat until lunchtime, you've just run the furnace for 4 extra hours. The whole point of a SMART Thermostat is that it remembers for you.All that said - it does actually correctly turn the heat on and off as expected, just not on its own.Edit: We found the time zone that works - you must set the times to Brazilian time - for us that is 2 hours early - at least now, during standard time. So instead of turning up the heat at 5:45 am, we set it to 3:45 AM and it comes up as expected. - I guess that means the thermostat is smart - just not from around here."
4.0,"Thermostat ""decided"" not to heat my home one night, in 10 degree weather!","  Setting the thermostat up in Alexa is easy enough.  I don't use a schedule but allow alexa to use the smart tech to control the temp as it sees fit, based on if it things people are awake, asleep, in the home, etc.  It's been fine for over a week, albeit a little chilly (I like it around 70 in the winter, not 68) but nothing unordinary.  It doesn't seem to be tracking energy usage in any helpful way.  As with all pro climate change indoctrinated things, the app seems more concerned about O2 emissions than how much electricity or gas is used.  No charts or graphs like my old Emerson thermostat had.But the thing that killed me was that one night the thermostat just decided that it wasn't going to heat my home all night.  I went to be at 10:30.  And woke up to a house at 59 degrees.  There's no way for me to tell if the thermostat actually turned on at night even once since the app doesn't provide much in the way of historic data (run time, heating time, fan time, etc.) and there's no information as to WHY the thermostat decided to freeze me out, considering that it was about 10 degrees outside much of the night.  I have the threshold set so that the coldest the house can get is 62 degrees.  How did it drop below this??  How did the thermostat allow this??  I know this is a new item for Amazon, getting into the home heating and cooling biz, but come on...more details in alexa about energy usage and historical data would be nice, and actually stick to the thresholds.  Man, if it was 20 below zero outside like it was last week...I would have woken up to a 30 or 40 degree home!"
5.0,SIMPLY GREAT. Simple to set up,  Finally Amazon built a thermostat just for Alexa (Thermostat is manufactured by Honeywell).  My house was built in 1963.  The furnace wiring did not have an additional power wire that is required so I added a C-Wire power adapter 24 volt that plugs into my wall plug (Adapter also bought from Amazon) Ran the connecting ends to the thermostat wall harness.  Connected the original wires from the furnace.  Red wire to the R wire connector marked R on the wire harness. Green wire to G connecter marked G on the wire harness and White to White and Blue to Blue and last the C-wire adapter wires one to the C connector marked C and one to the wire harness Rc connector marked Rc on the wire harness.The wire harness is the base for the Amazon thermostats.  Plugged in the C-Wire power adapter into the wall plug.  Attached the front of the Amazon thermostat to the wall plate that has all the wire connected to it.  Turned the breaker back on and the thermostat came on.  Followed the simple instructions in the Alexa apt and set up my new thermostat.  Very easy to program.  The White numbers on the thermostat are easy to see from across the room and are not intrusive.  Now if I needed it warmer or cooler I just tell Alexa what temperature I want the thermostat set to and Alexa does it and it's done.  Simple and easy and I love it.  And you can check your Alexa thermostat with you phone from anywhere and adjust it if you want.  Buy this unit you'll be happy.
4.0,"So far, so good.","  Installation went smoothly, and the app provides short videos. However I do believe Amazon could have provided a bit more information on R and Rc, as it isn't clear that the little slider connects R to Rc as if it had a wired jumper in place, for those that only have 1 wire.I like that I can put the furnace fan on circulate without the heater part running, but I do wish I could set up the interval of how often it runs. That seems to be up to the thermostat to decide and so far it hasn't been consistent at all. I have to go in each time and do it manually otherwise.The quality of the mounting bracket and thermostat itself is pretty good, especially for the price.  The display is a bit fuzzy (intentionally), and mostly monotone with limited amounts of information. For example, my old thermostat told me the time, which was nice. But this one only shows the temperature and a couple of icons.One thing I really don't like is having to go into the Alex app to adjust the thermostat or look at the temp. Amazon really needs to create an option of an independent app or at the very least a widget for the thermostat. The Alexa app is so slow and it takes a long time to drill down to the thermostat. I can't always ask Alexa to tell me the temperature, so a quickly accessed widget or app would be great.Overall pretty good though, and nice to finally see a much cheaper alternative to the overpriced Nest thermostats."
5.0,Great entry-level smart thermostat. It just works!,"  Even installing the c-wire adapter inside the furnace's control panel to enable the thermostat to function properly is simple to do with easy to follow instructions for both the thermostat and the adapter. The guided step-by-step setup built into the Alexa app is equally easy to follow. I love the price point of this device, and ultimately that's what sold me on finally upgrading my system to a smart one. Energy use tracking, control, and monitoring work just like every other Alexa device through the Alexa app. Being able to monitor and track temperature and energy usage in the app is top of the line functionality, and it's just the start of what's possible, with a price that effortlessly beats the top name competitors."
3.0,Cheap little device,"  They pluged right in to existing Honeywell adapter so setup was really easy, although once I get some paint I'll remove the old walplates.Be warned the Alexa app support is not really a thing for homes with two or more units. It allows you to name them but that is all. Alexa only controls one of them at a time either upstairs or downstairs for example. The other will run on the set schedule.Another note, disable Alexa hunches if you have a heat pump and aux coil. It's become apparent that Alexa doesn't understand that aux heat is less efficient and she will not smooth temperature transitions. As a result if your sleep and awake low points are greater than 3 degrees apart she will turn on the auxiliary heat to waste your money.The app will be getting a update to address some of this.I wish they had a standalone app for the thermostats that was lighter and easier to get to the settings, I favorited them but it's still a bit clunky to click so many times for a thermostat then back out and get to the other.Device ui is basic but works, it's intended to be paied with the app. It might be nice if they had a fancier model with a actual touchscreen so you don't need the app to set schedules and stuff.The auxiliary heat needs a option to turn it off unless the heat pump is not keeping up or going slower than expected. The constant of 3 degrees is just not friendly to smart thermostats and goes against the entire point of themIt would also be nice if they had room temperature sensors like the competitors."
3.0,Hunches doesn't work so well,"  I did have to pull in new wire. Which is a chore getting it up through the wall but eventually perseverance won out.I bought the amazon thermostat with the hope that hunches would work by knowing when we are home. When that didn't work very well, I thought that perhaps when my wife left in the morning, she could tell alexa that she was leaving and alexa would take that to mean the thermostat could be reduced to our preset away temp. Alexa does go into guard mode when my wife says she is leaving but the thermostat stays at our at home temp and never does lower. I monitor the temp on my alexa app from time to time while at work and nothing changes unless I do it manually. Maybe, the thermostat could be added to the things that happen in guard mode(?).I have not had a thermostat with Geo-fencing but maybe that works better.At this point we run it on scheduled mode. I will try the automatic (hunches) mode again in a week or so and see if it gets any smarter (or if I do).Oh, one more thing. When you order it the site tells you that you are eligible for rebates through your utilities provider. Amazon even emails you a link to the place where you can get your rebate. Just bear in mind that just because Amazon says this device is eligible doesn't necessarily mean that your energy provider or whoever is offering the rebate, is going to agree. It is not eligible in my area despite the amazon suggestion that it is."
4.0,Perfect Install Process!  2 Thermostats work great! Take pics of your wiring before the Alexa Setup,"  I replaced my 2 Honeywell thermostats with Amazon Thermostats.  I'm NOT an HVAC tech, just more handy than handsome. The DIY install process is straightforward and worked near-perfectly for me. I did one at a time and Alexa detected thermostat 1 and 2 just fine. I say the installation was near perfect because one of the thermostats stalled in the 1 minute final Alexa set-up and detected it needed a firmware update. It did work as the Alexa app directed me clearly and accurately. Pull the thermostat off, put it back on and wait 30 minutes while it updated. Gotta be patient, I saw it reset itself at about 25 minutes, but waited the full 30 before proceeding. That was on my 100M up/down fiber to home ISP service. Here's one tip in the install process; after you have your final wiring done, take a photo BEFORE you  snap the new thermostat on.  The Alexa configuration asks you to confirm the wiring connections in the set-up/configuration process.  Here's another good thing for anyone with a WiFi 6 / Eero Mesh network.  These little Amazon Thermostats connected like a dream!  No need to configure 2.4 legacy mode!  (That's why I made the change.  The old Honeywells would not connect properly to WiFi 6.)  I'm less than 24 hours into using them, so far, they work great!  I added photos of my home Goodman Furnace w/AC and my workshop-garage Guardian furnace.  Both are natural gas, forced air units.  Pretty standard  single zone systems."
5.0,Voice Control Heaven,"  As a person with low vision, I had to find a flashlight, then physically go to our old thermostat in order to see/change the temperature, and there was no automatic setting.  We ordered and installed this new one from Amazon, and I brought it online using the Alexa app, which was super easy.  Florida has wide temperature swings from quite chilly to quite warm (30’s to 80’s) over a period of a few hours, which used to necessitate constant resetting manually, but no more!  It is delightful to just tell Alexa what temperature I desire, and whether to heat or cool.  My vision will eventually be completely lost, so this is a necessity for me, but at the same time, it feels like pure luxury!  It responds instantly.  I would make one change only, which is to darken the color so that there is good contrast between the unit and the LED temperature readout.  With both being so light colored, it can be difficult to see even when it is dark in the room.  The LED should be much brighter.  As I can see the temperature in the app, it’s not a serious problem for me, although others may find it difficult.  Overall, I am very happy with the thermostat, and the price is good, so I recommend it highly."
5.0,Another Great Alexa/Amazon Product,"  I like this Thermostat. For one it works with Alexa. The Display has Big numbers and is easy to read. The app guides you through the install, made the process easy. I had two issues with the install app.I decided to take more pictures of the wiring and when I switched back I had to restart the process. The next problem is the picture they show you when they talk about the red “R” wire they say make sure the red switch is up. Nothing in the picture shows what they are talking about. I called in and it appears this is the Blue plastic slider below the red wire is what they are talking about. This appears to be a default position anyway. The other problem I had when trying to get the rebate using the Amazon App. If you look at the terms of the rebate it will boot you out of the process and you will have to start over. Also save a copy of your Amazon invoice before you begin the process because you can’t get to it once you start. That said I like the Amazon integration. Hope they add the Humidity soon. You can see it in the App though just can’t ask Alexa yet. I also hope they will add weather intelligence to save energy in the summer and winter."
4.0,"Great little thermostat, but the app needs improvement","  Install and setup was really smooth, the walkthrough in the app was very thorough and I had no difficulties with it. I’m impressed with the unit itself, it’s very small and lightweight for everything it does.My one complaint about the thermostat proper is that there’s no single button to toggle the fan mode, you have to rotate through all the modes to change it outside of the app.The Alexa app itself, however, could use some changes. It takes too many taps to get into the thermostat config to make any changes, it should really be on the default page. Fan control is somewhat buried in the UI and cannot be scheduled directly. Thankfully you CAN interface with it via Routines, so I was able to setup a schedule that way.I’m also disappointed that the Alexa app doesn’t have more iOS integration. There’s no support for Shortcuts or Widgets, so I can’t just create homescreen icons for my routines. Even in the app, it takes three taps to execute a routine. Very underutilized functionality, I don’t want to have to yell at my echo all the time."
2.0,"When it works, it works fairly good","  I installed it easily enough (I have a degree in HVAC/R, so it was a simple install for me), and got it set up fine, but operation is sketchy at best.I set the stat to 72°F for heat, it kicks on and heats to desire temp... Then the problem starts.  After it kicks off, it changes mode to some seemingly other setting, and doesn't kick the furnace back on, unless I set it back to heat again.  I do NOT have any schedule set because there's always someone at home, and always someone awake in the house (we have screwy work schedules), so it shouldn't be changing.Tech support reminds me of those cartoons of people turning into skeletons while waiting on someone, so I'm done with that.  I've reinstalled my old Honeywell stat and am just going to stick with that since I really don't need anything but a simple stat for my house.... I just happen to like tech (at least if that tech works without being a huge pain in the rear).  I could recommend 20 or 30 stats that I've installed that work better than this one."
3.0,Wish it would have worked for us,"  I'm not sure if we just got a bad unit or if the product development just isn't there yet. Our system was working great and then we installed this and suddenly the system was constantly on AUX heat. We called tech support and honestly it was just to new of a product for them to assist us with. Honeywell support wasn't great either. One local service call later, we decided it wasn't worth it and reinstalled our previous thermostat. We returned it and will be going with a different product."
4.0,Sleek and clean looking thermostat. Seems to be running well and using the fan much less.,"  This thermostat was fairly easy to install, but as some have mentioned specific wiring questions can be hard to get an answer. Attached on my old thermostat was a jumper cable and I was unsure if the new thermostat needed this. I was able to contact Honeywell chat and they confirmed no jumper was needed and to use the W2 wire. This is my first smart thermostat but I have had echos, fire sticks, and fire tvs so Alexa is very familiar. I would say for the price I am very happy and the visual is clean and pleasantly aesthetic. It seems it will save on energy costs, but in a future model I would prefer a physical button for heat and air. If you run a Dual Band Router make sure you are running set up on your 2.4Ghz band. I have had issues with Wyze Cameras and Blink Cameras when trying to set them up while on a 5.0Ghz band. For the price point and a starting smart thermostat I believe it is a great choice.Design is simple and clean. 5/5 StarsSetup is fairly intuitive unless you run into WiFi issues with 2.4Ghz vs 5.0Ghz dual band issues. 4/5 StarsAll heat, cold, and air settings are handled through one button on the physical device. 4/5 StarsAlexa works well but again kind of pain to have to use the app to quickly switch heat and air. 4/5 Stars"
3.0,"Update: now it just says ""There was a Problem"" and won't connect.","  Update 2: still waiting on a fix for the original issue, but I'm putting it back to 3 stars now as the connection seems to be working again.  Had to pull it off the wall and back on a couple times.  I considerer it a one off issue for now unless it happens again.Update 1:  The thermostat will no longer connect to the Alexa app.  See new picture.  My previous review was 3 stars because while it was working ok it had some frustrating flaws in that you can't set separate heat and cool modes properly.  If this doesn't sort out soon I will return it and go back to my old thermostat.  It is sad as I really wanted to like this and have 10 other Amazon devices that have been just fine.Original Review: Over all, it works well, was easy to install and set up.  The DIY guide on the phone is great and easy to follow for installing it.  But I've given it 3 stars for now because of 2 Issues I've found so far.  Hopefully they are addressed in an update so I can make it 5 stars.1) The preferred temp settings in the Alexa app.  There are 3 modes you can choose.  Heat mode, Cool mode and Auto mode. (see pic) However, if you change the Sleep temp to 68 for Heat mode you cannot set a sleep temp lower than 71 in Cool mode.  If you try and change the Sleep temp for Cooling to 68 then when you go back to Heat mode it will have changed the Sleep temp to 65. It is linked to the Auto mode's settings.  You can see in my screenshot that the temps will always match and thus it is applying the 3F min range of Auto to your settings in Heat and Cool.  It should be 3 separate modes.  The 3F min range should not apply to Heat and Cool.  And there is no way to disable the Auto mode.2) There does not seem to be an Alexa command to turn the Fan from On to Auto.  I can only change it from the app or the front panel.  I can change the temp, the mode and such, but not the fan.  This seems like an easy update."
5.0,"Easy set up 20-30 mins, take a pic of your wire set up before","  Easy set up, make sure to take a pic of old wire layout before swapping. The trim plate looks great as well, and comes with it to cover older typical thermostats backspace. My set up is on electric HVAC system. I’ve had wiring issues before with other thermostats but this one was very simple. Works perfectly with Alexa and further customization. This so far is one of my favorite smart devices in my home and would strongly recommend. Great value and quality build."
2.0,My wife cant control the Thermostat.. Locked to a single Alexa app account :(,"  EDIT: Customer support called me and explained that this is NOT supported.  All Alexa Smart Home devices are locked to the account under which it was activated..  So if you have a Smart Plug, Thermostat or anything, nobody else can use it in the household...-My wife has Alexa app on her phone and has her own Amazon account and we are in the same ""household"" and we can share Prime Shipping, Prime Video, Audible books, she can see all the Echo devices, FireTV devices, Fire Tablet devices, etc. etc..  BUT - the Thermostat is LOCKED to a MY Alexa app and account and we can NOT share it in the household.So - If I am not home, she can not adjust any Thermostat settings / Schedules and can also not remotely adjust temperature if she is away or en-route home to heat up the home.This should be fixed and its VERY confusing when all the other devices show up under her Alexa App, EXCEPT the Thermostat."
3.0,Not quite ready for the masses yet,"  This will be an amazing piece of tech once they get the bugs worked out for the price.  We have a heat pump system.  Any time the system would call for heat, regardless of the temp differential, aux heat would be on.  I feel like this is mething that could easily be fixed with some sort of firmware or software update.  It connects easily to Alexa, is some to operate and you can't beat the price but had to return it as Amazon tech support is, well, not good and was of no help. I verified 10 times that my wiring was correct and I do have an active C wire.  It just turned on aux heat for no reason.  Even the Alexa app said it was on.  I think they rushed this thing to market before the holidays.  It just needs a little more R and D and it'll be good to go.  Hope they get the bugs worked out because I'd really like to try this thing again someday when it works right."
5.0,It's good!,"  I replaced a smart Honeywell thermostat we've had for years, which has worked reasonably well, though recently internet connectivity has been somewhat intermittent.The Amazon thermostat came nicely packaged with everything I needed to mount it on the wall. The aesthetics are a significant improvement - I really like the size and the white color perfectly matched our kitchen. The display is also understated, and is a welcome change from the computer screen display of the Honeywell.The online instructions (through the Alexa app) were excellent. I had no problems with the wiring for our relatively simple heat-pump system.I've set it up to have Alexa control the temperature within the range I specified. It will be interesting to see whether smart control works. I had a Nest for a year and it's 'learning' was disappointing. Will this Amazon thermostat be better? I hope so!"
5.0,First Smart Thermostat,"  It is easy to install and control with Alexa app. If you have a simple force air furnace and AC system with C wire, the installation was straight forward. The cosmetic plate is useful to cover old thermostat unpainted area. I only have W, R, G, C, Y wires. Now I can change temperature remotely and not to worry about forgetting change setting after left home. You also can read humidity on the Alexa app, not on the unit itself. The control of heating and cooling actions are very responsive and much quicker than my previous traditional thermostat. The cost is right and good looking unit. Definitely recommend this product."
1.0,Shorted my heater,"  I was so excited to get this thermostat because I love everything Alexa related, but it was the worst mistake ever! I had a licensed electrician install this because I wasn't sure about the C-wire. It was hooked up and everything seemed to be working for about 10 min. Then it just started blowing cold air. I thought it was the thermostat, so I returned it. Since I'm a glutton for punishment, I though I'll try it again, maybe I just got a defective one. This time had my HVAC guy come and install it. Same issue. The HVAC guy said the fuse blew and the motherboard was fried. Long story short, parts were replaced, still couldn't get hot air to blow, tech support was called, no one could figure out why...and I ended up having to buy a new furnace. So my $60 thermostat choice ended up costing me over $4k and lots of stress. Never Again!"
5.0,Can't get it setup.,"  Probably should have given it 1 star, but installation was pretty easy.  I'm coming from a Nest thermostat that worked fine, but since i use a lot of echo devices I wanted to stay 100% amazon.  Anyway, like most ""smart devices"" or ""certified for humans"" devices there really is no troubleshooting.  I get it all hooked up, it says SEt, I go into the app it connects to wifi, i think good, good.  Then it has me pick my heating/cooling sources and it says its finishing setup, and just craps out.  Hangs at that point for like 2-3 minutes and comes back with something went wrong, Attemp retry or reach out to customer service...tried it with 2 diffrent thermostats on an android phone and fire tablet, all the same....getting an actual error message would be useful...something went wrong....so discriptive.11/13/21 Update.  Tech support has reached out to me several times to try a few things, still no luck,  It gets registered in the alexa app, tech support can see it get added, they still dont know why it fails at the final configuation step, tech rep said he will reach out again monday.01/22/22 Update.  So tech support called me probably 15-20 times over the past 2 months.  I've never bought a product from a company that didnt work as it should where they were so persistant in helping me, thumbs up for that.  In the end it would seem they pushed an update that finally made both of mine work.  After that it was a 2 minute install and setup, very easy.  I'm going to update my review to the full 5 stars from 2....it wasn't a great start, but the constant communication from amazon was a welcome change from what most customers experience elsewhere.  I'm also confident that if this wasnt a launch product in a new category it would have worked right away.  Scheduling is easy, having 2 thermostats in the same house works fine, and it works flawlessly with echo devices.  I've used Nest in the past, but I use amazon echo/ring devices for everything else so having everything seamless in one app is what I was after.  Would def recommend and will continue to trust amazon products knowing if something doesnt work right they have A+ customer service."
5.0,Great Smart Thermostat,"  This thermostat has everything you need at an affordable price. I purchased two to replace existing Honeywell thermostats in my upstairs and downstairs units. Installation was a breeze…basically plug and play since I was replacing other Honeywell products. The only thing that took about 30 minutes during install was connecting the existing C-wire to the furnace in my crawl space (the Alexa app walks you through how to do this).Now I have both thermostats on unique home/away/sleep schedules and they’re working great!  I also applied for the rebate through my utility company which will completely pay for one of the thermostats. Two for the price of one if your area offers a rebate!I do agree with previous reviews that the setup could be a bit more detailed as a novice DIYer would likely get lost. And the setup starting over from step one every time you go back to the app was a little frustrating.Overall, this was a great buy and hopefully I’ll see a few dollar reduction in my energy bill in a couple months."
3.0,Probably okay unless you have a heat pump or need tech support,"  After two hours with tech support, I realized that Amazon's support team for this product are not well trained on HVAC systems and their wiring. They continually referred me back to installation directions I'd already read and tried. After paying a contractor over $300, I learned that these thermostats will not work with our heat pump. Had to return it. All that expense and time could have easily been avoided had Amazon (Honeywell, actually) simply included a list of which systems work and which do not. Caveat emptor."
2.0,It’s decent but only one person can control the thermostat at a time,  It’s not bad but was pretty disappointed to find out that only one person can control the thermostat. Either I can have it on my phone or my wife can. What if I am away on business? She’s just it of luck? Amazon needs to update this.
1.0,Set up needs work and programming,"  Had this thing installed, wired they way they said too and it only displayed cool.  Heat didn’t even seem to be connected.  Spent all day trying to figure this thing out.  Still nothing.  Took it off my wall and getting ready to return this junk!!!!Newest updateStill won’t run on it’s scheduled settings.  I have to manually change the temp everyday.  Alexa doesn’t seem to even recognize this thermostat.  Ask Alexa to turn it up or down and it doesn’t work either.  For a smart thermostat, this thing is pretty dumb!!!!!  This is a don’t buy this product update!!!!!!Update:  I called a furnace guy in to help get it set up.  It’s working now, but he had to do other things to my one year old oil furnace to get it to work.  Work needs to be done on the set up guide and may not be compatible with normal oil Furnances."
1.0,Not Worth It Turns On Instantly on Temperture Drops of Just 1Degree - Support Bad,"  This is AWFUL!1) Hyper Sensitive to Temperature Changes  - cycles on off a lot *using MORE energy*The system turns on instantly as soon as a single degree temperature move happens.This happens a lot - but my older smart thermostat allowed me to set a range of 1, to whatever degree move where it wouldn't turn on instantly again.  ie: Set 70F, Temp falls to 69F turns on, heats to 70F. falls to 69F turns on again. <-- annoyingVs old Thermostat - allowed specify 2 degree deviation from set temp.  ie: SET 70F, Temp falls to 69F, doesn't turn on because told it allow 2 degree fall between on off cycles... turns on after 68F2) Needlessly Annoying to Schedule  - need multiple menus just to get to your thermostat.App is bad for this - would be nice to have a website to access and set.Only uses app(it seems) - no website to say set thermostat (checked with support who actually still couldn't help  me with this).For scheduling it is like the 1990s old school schedule thermostats.3) APP is AWFUL  Previously had and installed a Venstar Wifi system (a  old honeywell with 7/2 scheduling)  - both of those are more complicated system to install - Venstar had  UGLY app but its 1 click to access my thermostat temperature setting!!!  This thermostat uses the alexa app which needs 3 separate clicks to get your temperature setting.4) Support - asked about 2 settings above - terrible just sent me to youtube videos on the install - said power cycle.  They couldn't tell me if there is a website.Don't waste your time -  get a good one theres a reason this is always on sale at Amazon.  You will use WAY more heat/electric with this turning on and off and on and off with every 1 degree move!The app will drive you nuts - tried to make a iphone shortcut for On or Off but there isnt integration for this device/"
2.0,"Good idea, something is wrong though","  We got this about a week ago from a different big box store. We have it set to automatically stay between 68-71. It is 36* outside, ideally the thermostat would turn the heat on, then once it gets to a good heat, it would shut off, then turn back on when the temp cools down again. Well for some reason the heat doesn’t shut off until it gets to about 74*, which causes the AC to come on, so we have huge swings in temperature and it is definitely not saving any money. AC shouldn’t be coming on in 36* weather.I also tried it with just setting the heat to 67*, which somehow caused the temperature to go up to 84* in the house because again, the heat just didn’t kick off for some reason. So everyone in the house goes from freezing from the AC to melting because of high temps. I think we are going to end up just returning it. I like the Alexa integration, and it looks nice on the wall, but that’s really the only good things I can say about it."
2.0,Clearly Released Before it Was Ready,"  I'll try to keep this short and succint.1.  Install was a PITA using the app.  I'm one of the few that actually takes the instruction book and reads it before installing something to avoid problems, and that would have been nice here as...some issues could have been avoided.  Got it installed, but it took longer than it should have.2.  It does not work with my echo dots, which defeats the whole purpose behind this purchase.  My Honeywell did for years, but it starting going south so I ordered this thing, which doesn't work at all with my dots.  I'll probably eventually figure it out, but a few hours of troubleshooting later, which would never have been necessary if this thing was tested properly, still nothing.  Really displeased with this element.3.  The controls even through the app leave a lot to be desired and it's even worse at the device itself.This thing is a stinker.  With some updates it will maybe get better, but it was clearly not ready to go."
3.0,Important Feature Missing - BEWARE!!!,"  Okay, I wanted to love my new thermostats. I purchased three Amazon thermostats to replace three existing smart thermostats. Amazon really missed the mark on one important feature. In order to share control of the thermostat across multiple devices (i.e. mom, dad, children, house guests) you must give-out your username and password to Amazon account. WHAT THE HECK WAS AMAZON THINKING??? So, in order to let others control the thermostat, I have to also people have the username & password to my Amazon account where they can order merchandise, see my order history, etc. Oh, and just to be clear, this is per Amazon support when I called them because I couldn't figure out how to share my thermostat. My old smart thermostats made this easy and without having control of my account, just the thermostat."
3.0,Not worth it even at $50! Updated.,"  Would not finish setting up, even on 3 different phones with 3 different Alexa apps. Just keep blinking a red exclamation dot. Customer support is clueless and just kept giving me the run-around. Returning it for something more reliable.Figured out what was wrong. Had to figure out the 2 zone pump controller wiring to thermostat wiring. Got is figured out and now set up completed and the thermostat is up and running. Hopefully, I don't run into any onher issues other have delt with and will update in any other issues that come up."
5.0,Game changer!,
4.0,"Great price, but definitely a downgrade from other smart thermostats","  I replaced a 5-year-old ecobee thermostat with this for reasons that I'll get to.The installation went extremely well, but a lot of that is because I already had the wires labeled from the ecobee installation. I followed the instructions to connect it to Alexa, and overall, it works well, and I'm _generally_ satisfied. Do pay attention to the instructions and read other reviews, as WiFi interference can make or break this. I don't have multiple zones, but I read of some having issues who did. If you essentially need multiple thermostats, make sure you know what you are getting into before buying this.The ecobee stopped triggering the heat strips on my combined heat pump system. Didn't realize there was an issue until it got down in the teens one day (quite rare where I live), and I thought the heat was completely broken. A friend helped me diagnose and wire around the issue, and I simply lived with it for several years -- implementing the fix when it got really cold, and removing it when the weather warmed up.I miss the ecobee. With the data, it was easy to tell when the heat strips fired (when that circuit in the ecobee head unit worked, anyway) vs when the heat pump was doing all of the work, and there was an interesting (albeit, of limited use) comparison chart of how efficiently your HVAC runs vs others in the area. ecobee had a motion sensor and a fully interactive display.This has no motion sensor, and the display interactions are relatively limited (though still nifty enough, if this is your first smart thermostat). With ecobee, I could lock people out of turning on the cool air if I needed to (handy when you have kids or if the outside temp is in the 40s or lower). With this, you can only set a limit on how low it can be cooled or how high the heat can run, and these can seemingly only be changed through the Alexa app.Bottom line, I recommend this to anyone who has NOT already moved to a smart thermostat, if you are either technical enough to figure out how to wire it up, or if you are willing to pay an expert, or if you really want something that works with Alexa, and your current solution does not. A smart thermostat can be a godsend that can truly help your electrical bills.If you are coming from any other higher-end smart thermostat, though, I can't really recommend it. There will be some disappointment. I am already looking at the Honeywell options that integrate with Alexa."
3.0,It does not offer heat pump balance,  I bought this smart thermostat and installed it right a way but later one found it does not have any way you can adjust heat pump balance (the threshold in between heat pump and aux heat). the thermostat turns on aux heat if you adjust the temp over 2 degrees up so that means a lot of electricity will be used to heat up quickly. It would be nice to have options to turn on aux heat on right away or keep heat pump as the sole source. It is a nice thermostat otherwise. The install process is easy and everything is provided in the package.
5.0,Extremely happy so far!,"  I've used a Nest Smart Thermostat for several years. I just moved to a new home and decided to switch to the new Amazon Smart Thermostat rather than buy a new Google one. I got extremely lucky because the home I purchased had a Honeywell thermostat already installed. It used the same wiring bracket, so all I had to do was pop the old one off! It doesn't look as fancy, but it's definitely a decent looking device. What it lacks in aesthetics it definitely makes up for in ease of use and software features."
5.0,Don't listen to bad reviews about setup,"  If you have half a brain and can follow instructions,it's super easy to set up. Took me only 30 minutes. It's not a nest so don't buy it if that's what your looking for. Its ""smart"" capabilites are small.  But it's better than the og 10 cent builders grade thermostat I had before and I can control it with alexa so a definite upgrade for me. It looks sleek and is just bright enough it doesn't blind you a night but is still visible during the day. Hopefully amazon will make it smarter and add more features with updates down the road."
3.0,Needs a few software upgrades,"  Pros:good price, good design, easy installation.Cons: cycle time is extremely short. Compared to my old thermostat that would turn on twice an hour, this turns on every 10 to 15 min in a comparable temperature.You can’t adjust the swing temp and to cover for this flaw, you will need to adjust manually all day long.You might want to say, schedule? You can but you can just set three temperatures and schedule for four events a day. Why should I be limited to schedule more events and More temp sets? It is a software and easily adjustable. This is disappointing.So basically, I set it as “home” to warm the house for half an hour and then “away” for 2.5 hours and repeat this twice to get through the night with less energy. And not having the heater turend on 50 times instead of 15 tomes.If an upgrade does not come soon enough to resolve this issue, I’d rather return this and use my old thermostat."
4.0,"Great value thermostat, but needs some refinement","  Having recently moved house I was looking for some smart thermostats to replace the awful 1990s units installed in the property.I spent some time reading up on Nest vs Ecobee before coming across these. At half the price of the lowest cost models of both these brands I figured I’d give these Amazon own brand units a go.The positives:I like the very straightforward installation instructions and the really minimal display. You can access all the features on your Alexa app and I prefer the restrained design on my walls.I set up separate schedules for my upstairs and downstairs units without a problem and they have worked seamlessly.The thermostats hold temperature nicely, kick in early to get rooms warm for the scheduled time and are adjustable easily on the phone app.The negatives:I cannot get Alexa to adjust anything by voice command. Nothing. The App works great, but shout an instruction and Alexa claims to be unaware of any thermostat existing. Weird!The intelligent controls are a bit clunky and I have switched them off to let everything run off the schedule. I’m sure this will improve over time, but doesn’t feel very slick at the momentIn summary, these are good value, good looking and functional thermostats controllable remotely on your phone app. The smart functions need some work and Alexa speech function does not work for me at all. I might upgrade in the future if the smart functions don’t improve, but for now I think you’d struggle to find another option at this price that works as well."
3.0,Works OK except for one major flaw,"  So because this product is new, you won't be able to jump on you tube to get a bunch of info. Because of this I was hoping they would have a nice manual or at least a website where I could download one. It comes with a few page booklet to help install but that's really it. And to be fair, install was pretty easy. I'm still new so maybe there's something I'm missing or maybe they'll modify the software but here's what I don't like: You can select setting it on a schedule that you make up. The only other choice is it guessing what to set the thermostat at based on what you are doing. You tell it what temperature you want normally, when you're gone, or when you're sleeping. It recognizes where you're at and adjusts the thermostat accordingly. Problem is:  I want it cooled down before I go to bed. It doesn't adjust the thermostat until it sees you go to bed. This is a huge problem. To work around that, I figured I'd set a schedule but that like the nest, it would recognize when I've left the house and turn the heat/cool down when I'm gone automatically. It won't do that. When I have it on a schedule, I can control it from my phone if I'm gone so I could turn it off from work but it would be so much better if it just recognized I'm gone and turned the thermostat down. This product is a big disappointment and now I'm wishing I had paid for the overpriced nest thermostat instead. Don't expect any technical support. I'm not aware it exists. Amazon, you let me down."
5.0,Easy to install and worked perfectly,"  I replaced a 15-year-old Honeywell programmable thermostat. The installation went smoothly and integrated with my Alexa app without a hitch. The little wire identification tags can certainly help, but it's so easy, I could have gotten by without them. Turns out the wire colors match slot letters (e.g., R=Red, G=Green, Y=Yellow, and W=White. The ""C-wire"" was the only anomaly, which was blue). Especially helpful - the input slots for these apparently common wires were highlighted with a gray background, versus the neutral background for the rest. This made me feel extra comfortable that I had the wires going to the right places.So, good wire interface design, and the bracket attached with three conventional screws/drywall anchors (included). The kit includes an optional plastic decorative base. Because my old thermostat was larger and the wall had been repainted around it, I opted to use the plastic base to cover up the unpainted area. It fit/covered perfectly and looks totally professional.The last area that seems to get occasional poor ratings from other reviewers is the setup. Because this is an Alexa-type device, it requires a little different kind of setup thinking than thermostats in years past. In this case, the Alexa app simply ""Adds"" the thermostat, as it would any other compatible device (e.g., plugs, light switches, speakers, etc.). Nothing to touch on the actual thermostat itself. With that in mind, Alexa stepped me through the setup process with easy graphics. All went smoothly and I was in business.Overall, about 30 minutes to swap out the thermostats for my first try. I'm planning to install a second (2-story house with two furnace zones) to replace my downstairs Honeywell. Of course, I'll ""name"" it differently than my Upstate Thermostat, so Alexa will know which one I'm referring to when issuing commands.Highly recommended, and from what I can tell, a great price!"
4.0,"It works like a charm, for a fraction of the cost of a Ecobee","  My cents (I hope Amazon reads that and also considers it...):• There are no external sensors, like other brands. I assume Amazon might be building them, to sell them by 15 bucks each. I need at least one. HOWEVER, if they can be flagged as EXTERNAL or INTERNAL sensors, I guess the external can help the thermostat to understand what to do. That silly +-3/5 gray area between cold and hot can be mitigated. Since outside is COLD, just heat it up to 73. So the only gray zone would happen IF outside temp is casually the same temp as your goal. But 95% of the time, it will just work. My family likes it 73. Because of this ""OMG should I heat or cool"", it can drop to 71, or go up to 75. I would like to put it on AUTO and forget about its existence. But I cant.• I don't know what I did, but I guess I started with Celcius, then moved to F, it went crazy setting the upper and lower limits, in a way I simply cannot use the feature.• While my #1 doesnt get fixed, please add a ""when external temp from the city drops below my limit, switch to hot"" and vice versa.• It takes TOO LONG to open the app, find thermostat, to only them make a small change. Almost as quick as going downstairs. On Android, a widget would solve it.• The fan circulation is ""automagic"", but I would like to have it more frequent. There is no way. Or it is all in, all off, or ""automagic"".• Setup was pretty much easy for someone that had NO IDEA how to do it. Living here for 2 years, never had the change to do something like this. After some reading, I got it. I was a little cumbersome to understand the jumper on the bottom-right corner.• A nice energy dashboard on the web would rock. I found the one inside the app kind of useless."
1.0,C wire instructions are incorrect! And HEAT ON light does not work properly,"  Be advised, if you don't have a C wire, don't worry about it.  The instructions say you can't use this product.  It's wrong.  You will see offered here with the product, a C wire kit.  Don't get it!  It talks about running a new C wire from your furnace/boiler blah blah, it is a waste of time and too much effort.  All you need to do is bring in a new C wire, which is simply a 24V power supply.  You can do this easily with a 24V power supply plugged into the nearest outlet.  There is a C wire kit available separately (many actually) right on Amazon, like this one: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07MT5VWQN.  All you have to do is plug it in and run the wire to the thermostat.  Don't get the C wire kit that comes with the thermostat.  It's a little tricky getting the 24V (Cwire) behind the plate and into the thermostat, but it's not rocket science, you can just tuck it behind the plate.  I used a razor to cut a little groove in the drywall so the wire doesn't get pinched.I came back to change it to two stars because after a couple days of using this I found it does not show the red heat (flame) indicator when it's heating.  this is a big problem.  I'm sure it could be fixed with a firmware upgrade but it is insane that they could send these out without realizing a problem as big as this.  every thermostat shows you when it's heating or not.  This has a red flame light on the front that is designed to do that.  It just doesn't work.  When you press the button the light comes on for a few seconds and then it turns off, even though it is in heat mode.  You can check the app, or ask Alexa, and you'll find it is actually heating, but the red light on the front of the unit is not on as it should be.  this is ridiculous.  If they fix it with firmware I'll add some stars to my review."
1.0,don't throw away your old thermostat,"  There is nothing good I can say about this item, other than it was a good idea, but completely failed in implementation, and it looks nice.Installation was not terrible, it is simple enough to plug in the wires, and the extra large back plate looks nice.Once installed, it immediately had a ""Hunch"" that i wanted the house heated to 78 degrees (why!!).I disabled hunches, set up the auto temps, thought it was good, but you have to set every day separately, so the next day, the heat was back on (I live in Florida, not even sure why I need heat).So, I got that fixed, had it set to a 10 degree range, so it was saying it was off.  I was feeling warm, so I checked the vent, THE HEAT WAS BACK ON!!!  even though the thermometer said it was doing nothing.  So it does not even do what it is reporting to Alexa.Tech support was useless.  Things like check if heat is on, set temperature high, does it turn on the heat.  If the answer is no, there is no advise or steps to fix anything.  Calling tech support was also useless, they can return, replace, or give a discount on the broken unit (35% off a piece of garbage is still garbage).Back to my old thermostat.  I can't monitor it remotely, and it only sets to a single temperature, but that is still better than the Amazon Smart Thermostat"
5.0,"Works well. Used a transformer, not a C wire","  Set up was a little bit of a beast because I do not have a C wire and every YouTube video I watched told me to do it differently than it ended up working out, but I got it done. First, if you don’t have a C wire and it seems like a huge pain in the butt to install one, get yourself a transformer. Works just fine as long as you have an outlet nearby. Yes, there will be an unsightly cord, but it works. Second, usually Amazon people are super helpful, but they were not. The thermostat company, however, told me exactly what I needed to do immediately (Amazon will give you their number when you call if you don’t follow the directions and call Amazon like I did). That part was annoying, but once I actually got it set up - which took literally 5 minutes after talking to the thermostat company - it works exactly like I want it to. Some of the hunches are a little bit annoying, but they are usually pretty right on. It’s nice to be able to ask Alexa to turn the thermostat to 70, or whatever, before I even get out of bed on a cold morning. I’ve never used a fancy Nest, but if you have a simple thermostat already, it does everything you needed to do (turn on and off the heat/controlled via Alexa). I am satisfied and I’m sure it will save me some money in the long run.  Just don’t listen to random YouTube videos or you will be unnecessarily disappointed, haha."
