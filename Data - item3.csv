1.0,Read before you buy,"  This camera quality is awesome. As far as using for security forget about it. I have 3 indoor camera that work great. I bought 2 cam v3 for outside. They are basically junk they alert you on bugs, tree blowing, lights from cars shining on trees. Unless you have a yard without anything blowing or bugs flying around then don’t bother for security. I’m talking about events happening non stop all night long. I set the security all the way down and didn’t help at all. Ive watch 50 videos with nothing in them. Day time i think is fine so hopefully if you have criminals in your neighborhood they only work during the day."
5.0,It's superior to v2.  It is.,"  It seems to cue up in the app faster than v2, the night vision also works extremely well.But I want to explain, since I see some people saying color night vision doesn't work.  No, it works...but you didn't follow the instructions.  Thus let me help you out.You see, ""color night vision"" is not actually night vision.What?I said color night vision is NOT actually ""night vision"".TO understand, you need to understand ""light"".Night vision works by using infrared light, which is seen by the camera lens (but not the naked eye).  That's why you can't use an IR light for a camera facing a window; it's just going to reflect itself.TO solve this, you could put an IR blaster outdoors, but pretty much all of them require hardwire power.  Which defeats the purpose since a baddie could just cut the power.Enter ""color night vision"" - which again is not night vision.Cameras, all cameras, have a sensor.  This sensor needs light - regular light.  It behaves very similar to your eye; you can't see things without light.  The more light, the easier it is to see things.However, sometimes you can't increase the light level, yet you still need to see objects.In camera tech this is done by way of ISO, which is essentially a setting that tells the camera to compensate for lighting conditions - you can make things appear ""brighter"" or ""darker"".So...you combine a larger sensor with a higher ISO, and what you get...is ""color night vision"".In other words, all the camera's doing is amplifying whatever ambient light is there in order to improve the picture....ah, I see it's clicking to you now.TO use color night vision, NIGHT VISION SHOULD BE OFF.  Not ""on"", not ""auto"".  OFF.I know this doesn't make sense due to the naming.  But trust me on this.If you leave it ""auto"" the camera will sense that there's not enough light and just go to regular night vision (which will be black and white because color is not perceived through IR lighting.  Remember, IR sensors can't see the full spectrum of color).If you turn it off, the camera will simply adjust ISO based on whatever lighting is there and that's what you get.Now, you have to be realistic.  If there's literally NO ambient lighting whatsoever - I'm talking pitch black, no stars, no moon, NOTHING - you might as well do regular night vision with IR.  Or just get some light in there.  It doesn't need to be a lot - the side of my house has a single Phillips Hue bulb set at the lowest and I get full brightness through color night vision.SUMMARY:  color night vision needs at least some light to actually work, AND you must turn regular night vision OFF."
1.0,WYZE Products: From First to WORST,"  As a techie with 78 WiFi devices in my home, I’m VERY critical of the products that protect my family indoors and out. WYZE cams and their other products had been my favorite, until this Fall. Here’s why:1. One of my WYZE cameras died after a firmware update. App asked to upgrade firmware to 4.9.6.241 and immediately after doing so, the camera  became non-responsive.2. After one WYZE cam died, I took one of my indoor WYZE cams that was working perfectly and moved it outside to replace the one that died. Immediately upon connecting it, the full color images I got indoors turne to black & white. No more color. black & white.3. Two WYZE WiFi Contact Sensors in my home stopped working. I replaced the 3V CR1632 batteries. Despite seeing the tiny red light flashing as required, they refused to link to hub on back of one Version WYZE Cam.4. WYZE door lock was OK in general but geofencing feature that’s supposed to sense home arrival and unlock the door has NEVER worked. This means I was stuck having to enter code on the tiny separate keypad which WYZE makes you pay extra for.5. Received a brand new WYZE Cam V3. Setup procedure identical to prior version 2 and 1. However for some odd reason, this cam would not connect to either of my 2 WiFi channels with strongest signal.6. WYZE Cam V3 does NOT fit in their outdoor housing I used for prior versions. Nevada sun is brutal on cheap plastic so it turned my V2 cams to a brittle yellow color. Did same to the WYZE outdoor camera housings. Making things even more frustrating is fact that WYZE Cam 3 does not have a 1/4-20 threated hole for attaching to industry standard outdoor wall mounts. All they give you with the camera is a very cheap picture hook kind of cut-out which I would never trust on a windy day.7. Despite all my 76 other WiFi devices including cams from Tuya and Zmodo working perfectly, 2 WYZE cams have taken themselves offline and refuse to reconnect.SO WHAT MIGHT BE THE CURRENT BEST SECURITY CAMERA? Get one of the many on Amazon that use the VicoHome app. Here's why:1. When you get an alert and open the app to that camera it IMMEDIATELY shows you the motion that triggered the alert. Examples: If it's an Amazon delivery in front of your home, you'll see it. If it's an Amazon package on your front porch, you'll see it. I have 2 cams aimed to do exactly that.2. I have 3 Model CG6 from DCDVR also because they have internal batteries, which WYZE lack.3. They have standard 1/4-20 threads holes on the back so you can use existing wall mounts (another thing the latest WYZE cam lacks).4. DCDVR has never hit me with firmware updates or website crashes like WYZE constantly did.5. Just looking at a CG6 cam next to any WYZE cam will tell your eye that one is a toy and the other is a professional security camera that is built to withstand all outdoor weather conditions for many years."
1.0,Cam Plus Doesn’t Work,  We ordered 3 of the V3 cameras. I’ve got to say the clarity and night vision are awesome. We don’t get night vision in color though. Also when you set them up make sure you have SD cards because cam plus is an absolute JOKE. You get nothing but error codes on the event videos that make these cameras worth the money. For instance if someone was breaking into your home the camera would alert you but then it would throw up an error code that it cannot retrieve the event video from the cloud. You can still watch the person come in on the cam if you know that is what is happening. I had faith in Wyze but we are so frustrated with not being able to see the event videos that we want to return them
1.0,"Extremely disappointed, have to pay extra for worthwhile features","  Extremely disappointed in this camera, under the impression it would take footage of individuals approaching your home. This was to be used overnight. I spent over 45 minutes speaking with a Wyze customer service representative, not once did she indicate I had to purchase their plan Cam Plus to record full-length videos, or  receive alerts when people are detected.  My intention was to obtain footage of any individual approaching the house. The only footage I get is  vehicles driving past our home or motion from trees, in our yard. If you want motion from an individual walking up the driveway to your porch, forget it, it didn't even catch the mailman coming up our walkway.  The time frame 12 seconds should be longer time, once it catches the 12 seconds video event, you  have to wait for it to reset. I purchased the Wyze 32GB microSDHC card, if you want it to film continuous footage, expect to spend the time watching minute by minute, to catch any activity.My point is, if you want a camera to catch vehicles and motion from trees,  this camera will fit the bill."
1.0,"Not alexa compatible, apparnetly","  I linked the camera to the Wyze app (and its working).I linked the app to Alexa (and it says connected).I've said ""Alexa discover devices"" multple times, every time nothing.Alexa show me Front Porch (the camera name)Alexa responds ""Sorry, I didn't find a device named front porch"".Unlinking & re-linking did nothing.The closest thing to support I found says:  Note: You must have a Wyze Cam v2 or Wyze Cam Pan to connect with Amazon AlexaWhich I guess means v3 is NOT compatible..."
4.0,"AMAZING pictures and night image, sound is low and unrealiable","  I wanted a cheap home monitoring setup, and this camera is an AMAZING VALUE.  for under 30 dollars you get a HD camera that is wireless (although powered with a USB cable) that can record continuously on a micro SD card (up to 32 GB).The V3 has great images, a decent frame rate, two way audio with an 80 db siren you can activate.  The night feature means that even without ANY light, you can clearly see things happening.The trick that Wyze does is give you 3 weeks of their cloud recording to spoil you with ready access to all recording, when without the paid subscription you only get a 12 second video every 5 minutes, which is stored for 14 days, which is not bad.  I'm getting used to the subscription bonuses and may well decide to spend the money to keep them.  For someone who is only interested in coming home to review what the cat did all day, you might decide not to spend the money on the subscription.If you choose to put an SD card into the camera it will record 24/7 (and delete the oldest footage when it gets full) but you have to remove the card to put it into a device to see the recordings.  If someone steals the camera AND the SD card you may be out of luck to see who did it.The subscription is only $1.25 per month per camera and you get unlimited cloud recording plus a bunch of notification features such as alerts when the camera hears Carbon monoxide or Smoke detectors alarms.The audio features of this camera are its weakest feature.  Crackly audio or dropout is common, and its best to place the camera where is has fewer walls for the wifi signal to pass through.  The V3 only transmits on a 2.4 ghz signal (which is better for passing through walls anyway, but if it's outside you can sometimes make a big difference in connectivity by shifting the camera a few feet.  The data on the camera image shows how much data is being sent at any given moment, and if you don't have a solid data connection the audio suffers.Also, the audio volume from the camera to whoever your are talking to is fairly low, so above a certain height and distance they won't be able to understand what you are saying.  If you mounted in at eye height by your door, visitors would probably not have a problem hearing you, provided the camera has a solid wifi connection.This camera has SUPER night imaging capability, and switches from black and white night mode to color night mode if it detects motion.  You set the detection level for each camera so that minor movements like branches waving in the wind don't result in unwanted alerts.  You can also set audio trigger thresholds depending on the environment.  My camera looks at a 60 watt light fixture and manages to not become totally blown out.Setting up the cameras is very easy, you install the app and create an account, then push the setup button under the camera and log into your wifi.  A code is sent to your registered email account that gives you control of the camera, and even offers an optional two-step login to prevent possible hacking of your system.  As it stands, even the single stage login feels pretty secure, but it's nice to have the option, which you can turn on later.Each registered camera appears on your app screen, and you pick the camera you want to look at or configure and tap on it.  managing 6 cameras is as easy as one camera, even if it seems repetitious to have to individually configure each camera separately.These cameras are made to work outdoors and are IP66 rated, so dust and moisture should not be a problem, but I do intend to protect mine by mounting them where they will have some overhead cover from the elements.If you want an inexpensive home monitoring system that doesn't actually require a subscription (though you will probably WANT the subscription) then I haven't seen anything that approaches the V3."
5.0,The only one that didn't have significant lag time in the live feed!,"  I like these little cameras!  Setup was a breeze, picture quality is amazing, and the live feed is pretty much actually live (less than a 1 second delay for me, which was the best of all the newer cameras I tested - more about that below).  Real time live video is important to me for various reasons.  For example, one of my dogs keeps peeing in the house (marking), and if I can't catch him just before he pees then he's never going to learn to stop doing that. With a delay of even 3-4 seconds, I would be too late.These cameras are small and light.  The base is magnetic and very adjustable, and there are also adhesive and screw-in options for mounting.  Low light performance is exceptional - the IR night vision isn't needed until it's pretty much completely dark.The app is so-so..  it is responsive and more or less intuitive, and it does have all the basic capabilities needed. It just lacks some features that I would have liked.  For example, you can't fast forward through event videos or continuous recordings.  To jump to other points you have to move a bar on the timeline..  it is very difficult to skip just a tiny bit ahead.  I keep going too far, then going back too far or not far enough, and it's a pain.  You have to guess where to look for things.For this reason, continuous recording was not a great solution for me, because it was too hard to find events.  Recording events only is better, but I'd still like the ability to fast forward, or to see the actual video as you move your finger along the timeline.Speaking of recording events only to your SD card:  SD card recordings are NOT subject to the 12 second video/5 minute cooldown that you get with the free cloud recordings.  If you choose ""events only"" in the settings, it will break time into 1 minute increments, and it will continue recording until motion stops.  This wasn't made clear in any of the documentation I could find, and the live chat agent gave me incorrect information.  I almost gave up and returned these before even opening them, but first I decided to message them on Facebook.  The Facebook messenger representative gave me the correct information and links to where I could find more detailed information on their website. So, crisis averted.The audio is pretty terrible in recorded events.  It sounds like you're talking from across a long tunnel while holding your hand over the microphone.  When right up next to the camera outside, I can understand speech, but it still does not sound good.  It is slightly better indoors.  I don't know what the sound is like for the live feed though, and I don't know how it sounds when I talk through the camera.  (I haven't had anyone here to help me test things like that.  The dogs won't cooperate, they all want to be in the same room as me all the time).For me, the fact that there is almost no lag in the live video more than makes up for the shortcomings in audio.  Plus the price is great -- a lot more than they were before May, unfortunately, but still very competitively priced.  As soon as they're in stock anywhere, I'll be adding two pan cameras for inside, and maybe their doorbell, depending on whether or not there is enough space on my door frame.Here are all the cameras I've had/tried, to give you all some comparisons.  This will be long, but the summary is that between Dericam, Blink, Eufy, Eufy Solo, LittleElf, and Wyze, I liked the Wyze ones best.I did not test Ring because they are really expensive and have no options for local storage at all.  You have to pay for a subscription for each camera if you want to view recordings.  I didn't test Arlo because they're expensive and I hadn't gotten to them yet.  No need to do more testing now though, I'm keeping the wyze cameras.1. Original indoor cameras that I want to replace - Dericam 1080P P2, indoor pan/tilt, purchased in 2017.  They're old now and are showing their age, but there is virtually no lag time at all in the live feed, and you get all features and local storage without ever paying any fees. The app is kind of buggy and annoying (and slow by today's standards), but these cameras served me well for 3-4 years.  They are deteriorating now though, and it's time for an upgrade.2. Blink mini outdoor, 5 camera kit (ordered on prime day, so I got a really good deal).  The Blink cameras were really nice (image quality, sound, features, ease of installation), but I had a consistent 3 second delay in the live feed.  (My network is not the issue.)  It's really too bad, those seemed perfect otherwise.  I tried every single troubleshooting step and anything that other people mentioned having done in message boards.  No difference though, I always had a 3 second delay, so I returned them.3. Littlelf 1080P, pan/tilt etc.  Priced around what wyze cameras cost.  As far as I can tell this company only makes indoor cameras, so I would have had to get a different brand for outside, and use two apps to keep track of my house.  Not really want I want, but Lifflelf promised the ability to see multiple live streams at the same time, so I wanted to try them.  That feature does work and is actually really nice.  Good image quality (but not as good as the other newer ones), good audio, an app that was a little clunky but definitely usable... but I had a 4 second delay with these cameras, so they went back.4. Eufy - EufyCam E, 2-cam kit.  These were by far the most expensive cameras I tried, but they promise a year of battery life, and I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get power outside at that point.  The cameras seem really solid and well made.  I had no trouble adding the homebase and camera, although I did have a lot of trouble creating my account in the first place. The app seemed less intuitive than Blink or Wyze - (not a dealbreaker), but worked.  Image quality was great, sound was great, but I found that these had a 3-4 second delay.  For the price, they would have had to be perfect.5. Eufy Solo  IndoorCam P22 (pan/tilt), and Solo OutdoorCam C22 (which looks like a big eyeball, I really liked the design). The price of the indoor cameras was similar to Wyze, but their outdoor cameras were a lot more.  I thought that since these cameras connect directly to wifi and not to a base, they'd be faster.  I was wrong though, I had the same 3-4 second delay as with the other Eufy cameras.  Video quality is great, but not as good as the wyze v3 in my opinion.  Audio quality was really good with these.  But the delay was a dealbreaker.The End.  I applaud you if you got this far!"
1.0,"Constant Disconnects, missed recordings, false alerts.","  After my terrible experience with Wyze v2’s, I decided to try out the v3’s. My logic was that it couldn’t get any worse.I was so wrong. Continuous disconnects, false alarm after false alarm, app lock ups, a bit rates dropping to below 10kbps.My Eufy 2k Indoor cameras  suffer ZERO of these issues, have better picture quality and cost $5 more.Save yourself the headache and ignore the flood of fake and paid reviews. I’m giving these to someone I hate so they can be their problem.0/10. I’m done with Wyze."
1.0,Unusable due to poor sound quality. Audio is not functional. Only static.,"  I purchased this camera to use as a baby monitor. Unfortunately, the picture quality is great but there is a constant static sound when the sound is turned on via the app. This effectively renders the camera unusable as I need sound to monitor in addition to video. I tried moving closer to WiFi, resetting, no effect. Will return unless support can offer a solution. Unfortunately also, it appears from searching online that this is a common issue that has existed since the cameras were released without any solution yet.UPDATE 5/19/2021: I spoke to Wyze and was sent a replacement. The second V3 has the identical problem to the first, nothing but garbled static for sound. After researching online it appears this is probably the case with all their cameras (V2 and pan) but most people are not using them for audio recording. This is a total deal breaker for me as Wyze obviously knows of this issue but chooses the same poor components for new products."
1.0,Soooo many false notifications,"  Wanted to love these and the reviews were good, but plan to be hammered by notifications about motion detected when there is no motion.  These cameras are just not ready for prime time until Wyze can sort this out.  I'm assuming they do this on purpose to get you to subscribe to Cam Plus where they say you'll get 70% less notifications.  Clearly they know about this and use this as a methodology to bank coin.  Tough to use these as security cameras given you never know if a notification is accurate or not and have to look at the video for every notification.  Plan to spend some time every day just filtering out false positives  - you have been warned."
5.0,So far so good,"  Got it on April 3, 2021. (Today is April 14, 2021.) So far so good.Installation: Very very easy. Following the instruction in the manual, I just connected the USB cable for power, installed a smartphone App, configured the app for connectivity, and put a MicroSD card. If you have any difficulty, ask Google (e.g., how to setup Wyze cam). You will see a few good helps including Y**t*be video clips.Regarding the video: On April 3, I put a 32GB MicroSDHD card (that was formatted with GUIFormat program available free on the Internet). I set the video quality to SD for continuous recording. Wyze generates one mp4 file for one minute. The 32GB card could hold 4-days SD videos. The SD video quality was good enough. Today, I put a 128GB MicroSDXC card (that was, again, formatted with GUIFormat program). The file system should be FAT32 (not exFAT nor NTFS). I first formatted the card to NTFS in Windows. Then, I formatted it to FAT32 with GUIFormat to avoid ""currently-being-used error"" of GUIFormat. Wyze Cam has had no issue with it. In order to extend the length of recordings in the card, I switched the quality to 360p (which is not much different from SD 480p). I have not checked the visual quality yet, but it should be not much different from that of SD.Regarding subscription: Though the cost of subscription is not much (around $15/year? for each cam), I decided not to subscribe the service. Since the device records continuously and the 128GB card can hold around 20 days records, I can refer to the recorded video files if needed. I mean, I can rely on the recordings instead of cloud. I will let you know later if the no subscription option is good OK.Hardware and software quality and durability: Again, so far so good. The device is a bit warm, but not hot. I hope the heat does not cause any trouble in the long run. So far, the device is working very well, continuously recording without any issue. The Android app/software is very good. I am sure iPhone app also functions well, too.I will report my experience several weeks later."
3.0,Night color feature doesn't work,"  Video quality is better then their v2 cameras, but I bought this for the full color night vision recording but as you can see in the picture that feature doesn't seem to be working just looks like normal night vision and that's with the IR light off. Very disappointed hopefully something will be updated in the software"
5.0,2021 Review: Don’t trust the 1 star reviews,"  I almost did not buy because of the scathing 1 star reviews, but it seems like they may be from competitors or amazon wants you to buy their cameras. I searched online (not on amazon) and this camera kept coming up as one of the best. I thought the price it was easy to risk it, and so happy I did. The camera is wonderful. I plugged it in, connected to the app and it’s been wonderful. I face it out a window towards the alley and it detects the differences between people and cars and other motion. It gives me alerts, let’s me view the events, and gives me peace of mind. I’ve ordered several more and also recommended to friends.Easy setup, long cord, comes with magnet mount. Clear picture, immediate alerts. No reason to not have one of these in the house. Only downside is you can’t rotate it but I’ve got a cat camera for indoors."
4.0,Wyze V3 vs Blink Mini,"  The picture series has Wyze first and Blink Mini 2nd in all shots. First pic is of both at my wall mount. First comparison is Image Quality as cameras capture in daytime. I am standing at 20 ft from cameras. Next enlargements are done by zooming thise images on IPhone 12 Pro Max and doing screen grab of each. Wyze wins with sharper images. Lastly is night vision comparison. Night vision is hugely better on Wyze. Why have a security camera if someone breaks in and their faces are blurry? Pros and cons: First Amazon owned Blink feels more solid product support wise, long term as its a bigger name with likely more resources. I had cheap Chinese MIPC based cameras before - what a joke! 2nd I don't want images in cloud. I want local discreet storage. The Blink system can give that with Bluetooth available USB sync module storage possibility. The Sync Module can be hidden in a outlet in a cabinet or a location not nearby. That is better than Wyze. Micro SD cards in camera (Wyze) mean suspect can steal them or destroy them easily - so this is a strike against Wyze. Lastly I don't like the pigtail on the Wyze V3. I know they did this for sealing/weather tightness. But they could still do a co injection molded sealed insertion of the connector at the camera body. Cameras should all have flat round common diameter bottoms, designed properly and have common interfaces for hookups and wire concealment in wire tracks. In this way they fit avariety of mounts. For wire concealment I use Legrand Cordmate C10 white wire channel it works very well. Standardize all interfaces please. So really neither has their act together 100%. But Wyze has most important feature, Image Quality, correct."
3.0,Great price but need improvements,"  I have a love/hate relationship with Wyze’s security cameras. I love the low cost of their cameras. It’s easy to install and setup. No subscription is required (but with limitations)! Live view, for the corded cameras, loads very quickly.I hate the significant notification delay when the camera detects motion. I’m talking about up to a minute delay (at times 2-3 minutes)!! So don’t expect to be able to speak with anyone through the camera because they’ll be gone by the time you get notified of their presence.I get a lot of false alerts. The camera detects “motion” from moving shadows and headlights at dusk. I live in the center of two busy streets so it’s difficult to aim the camera away from the passing cars on either side. At night, I’ll get notifications of every car that passes because of their headlights. During the day, adjusting the detection sensitivity reduces the amount of false alerts from cars.Error code 07 occurs a quote a few times which prevents video playback of an event.I also get missed motion detections. I had an amazon delivery today (March 26 at 10:18am) and 2 cameras failed to detect the driver. My last notification for the day was at 8am so it wasn’t caused by the “cool down” limit.The camera also has a short cord so you’ll need to purchase their extension kit if you don’t have an outlet within 5 ft of your installation spot.I also own 2 wireless outdoor cameras. One is installed on the side of the house without a nearby exterior outlet and the other camera is in front of the house on a tree that is roughly 15 ft from the house. Two weeks after installation, the battery percentage is at 80%. The live view loads a lot slower when compared to the wired cameras. It takes 15-20 seconds to load live view whereas the wired cameras load live view within 5 seconds."
1.0,The App doubles as monetization scheme,"  The entire app, required to use this product is a constant nag for you to give them a subscription fee for their cloud services.I’d rather pay five times the amount for the camera and never have to deal with that design.I also think the app is really confusing and it took me a while to actually understand how to set things up for sound and motion recording. I don’t know why there wasn’t included directions printed how to actually click on stuff and make things happen. Maybe because they redesigned the app so often I don’t know.But needless to say I open the app and reminded many times that I can get the stupid “plus” service.They won’t stop telling me how awesome it is with all of the design and the user interface is specifically split between “plus” functions To show you what you’re “losing” if you don’t give them money every month.I also had no idea that you couldn’t record locally without an SD card I wish that somehow that was more obvious before I bought it. But I think they purposely don’t include one so they can try to upsell you in cloud storage and the physical product costs less.Call me old-fashioned but I would like to just use my product and not being nagged for money all the time. I wouldn’t recommend this product to anybody just for that reason alone. This product honestly is the worst of what a smart phone era has to offer. I’m sure the subscription BS is at least moderately effective and they make money ...but I think Just because you can make money doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s OK.I understand this model with FREE games/apps because you don’t pay for the entire thing. But consider some thing like iphone. When you purchase the physical product, it has local storage that comes with it and it tells you that you can do cloud services but it doesn’t consistently remind you all the time that you’re not paying them for cloud services. Every time you look at your pictures it doesn’t say “Hey you could have more space on your phone if you bought our stuff”.Something about the design of this makes me feel like part of it should be illegal. Because you’re paying for a product But still wasting your time being nagged. And the entire design is just a mental game to press you for more money. Yay capitalism.The actual camera and tech itself is pretty good. But honestly I’m just so sick of this type of crap.Needless to say I don’t think I want to buy any Wyze products. Somehow all of my other smart devices don’t seem to be advertising to me like this. Their apps focus on actual utility, not monetization gimmicks."
5.0,See for yourself,"  The top photo is the new v3, and the bottom is the Wyze cam outdoor WIRELESS (also much more expensive)Both cameras are right next to each other with the same lighting, taken minutes apart. Needless to say I love love the v3 and I bought 3 more. So much better than their other cams for so much less."
5.0,Great improvement over the v2!,"  I've owned multiple Wyze Cam v2's since 2018 and while they have worked wonderful since, the improvements in the new version (as well as the cost) persuaded me to upgrade.The improved camera sensor is literally a night and day difference. In cases where the cam v2 would switch on the infrared lights and go into ""night vision"" mode no longer occurs with the v3. The ability to choose between ""near"" or ""far"" IR lights is a bonus as well.One other major improvement over the v2 is the weather resistance rating. There is a short micro usb cable that is connected to the back and is permanently connected to the camera to seal it from the elements. On the other end of the cable is where you plug in the included power cable. This part of the connection is sealed by a rubber-like tip. Even the port for the SD card has a small cover. Good attention to detail.Setup is quite simple. Download the app, log in or create a Wyze account, select add device, and choose the correct product. The directions walk you through the rest. One thing I will point out is that you need to select a 2.4ghz Wi-Fi network. It may list your 5ghz network and the camera will tell you it couldn't connect. It might be useful if Wyze added some text to the network select screen mentioning that. EDIT: It appears the app now tells you.One point I like to mention to new possible buyers is that you should not rely on these or any other similarly priced camera's for security purposes. They are great for keeping an eye on things, but if you are solely looking for something to provide security you should be looking at spending a bit more."
5.0,WYZE Cam V3 is simply wonderful and the negative reviews - are extremely silly!,
1.0,1 of 2 cams purchased work,"  07/14/21 - Personally , I love Wyze , but I'm leaving this review at 1 stars for now. When we received the cameras , both of them worked for a day or so , but one camera ended up disconnecting and saying ""ready to connect"" endlessly. Sadly I unplugged it and havent used it since.  Ive tried multiple factory resets and updating the app etc , to no avail. I hope customer service can help me out with this one. The other wyze cams we have work wonders. I think I just got a defective one.Update - 07/15/21 After a nice Wyze Rep (Josh) tried to help me over the phone , to reset/firmware flash the cam , we were unable to get it working , and Josh confirmed we would be able to exchange the unit. Via email I was directed to a new Rep (Antonette) who said we would be unable to exchange the camera , since it was past 30 days from purchase.... Wife and I recently had a baby , so that took precedence over anything else. We ended up buying a new Wyze Pan Cam from Amazon... fingers crossed this one works properly. As we purchased it to keep an eye on our baby while at the beach. I just wish Wyze would follow through with what was said from one rep , or not mention it all. Just be consistent... unlike the camera I received."
1.0,Worst Customer Support of any company I have ever dealt with :(,"  This company makes a great product, and things rarely go wrong, but when they do beware that you are screwed, their customer service is absolutely worthless. Had a new camera that would not work out of the box (support ticket 1184279that has been going on for two weeks trying to get a replacement approved."
1.0,"Good Camera, Poor Software Features, Shady Subscription","  I should preface this review by saying that I almost never write bad reviews and that my expectations for this camera were low.  That said, given the price point (and favorable reviews) I honestly thought I'd be pleased with this.The camera is pretty amazing. Sure the detail could be better, but I have it mounted on a second story windowsill overlooking the backyard and our cars. I don't think it's enough to make a positive ID but I'm honestly quite impressed with the picture quality. The night vision is truly fantastic. For what I paid, it's great.On to the software (android app)... This leaves a lot to be desired. Very little customization. Weak detection often misses people. The alert system is extremely basic. Like... it's bad. I literally can't speak enough about all the seemingly bare bones features it lacks.Mind you, I'm not expecting much here. But I should be able to set a detection area that sends me alerts for people (not every car rolling through the neighborhood) within it. I should be able to set a smaller detection area that alerts me LOUDLY on my google home devices if a person is detected during certain hours. I should be able to access the camera (security) when connected to a VPN. I should be able to customize the notification tones on my phone. I should be able to access all of this from a website on a web browser, not just my phone. I could go on and on for days about how basic and devoid of features the software is. Just a few ""if this, then this"" options would go a long way.But honestly the worst part of all is that today I discovered that the annual subscription price for the ""Cam Plus"" features... is per device. That's right, it's $20 (seems reasonable at first), PER CAMERA. I can overlook the poor software and hope that these basic features become available in the future, but the per camera subscription fee is enough to make me say with certainty: DON'T BUY THIS. A flat annual subscription fee should be an incentive to purchase more cameras.I rarely write bad reviews, but I'm honestly very disappointed in this."
1.0,Brand loyalist NO MORE,"  I have purchased over 40 of these cameras for personal use and gifts to family members. My first review on here marveled at the “Value” these cameras deliver. Well .... after 2 years + I have extensive use and now “User history” and let me tell you, buy another camera. Trust me, I do not have an ax to grind, nor do I wish them ill will but they got greedy, grew too fast and their reliability went off of a cliff.After all, reliability is the most coveted quality of a surveillance camera. What really blows, is I have my interface and software set up so I can’t just get rid of them all and start over with a reliable brand without great expense and hassle..... Unless someone wants to buy all of the working cameras from me! You will love this camera for about 9 months and after they perform several firmware “upgrades” your camera will cause you all types of problems."
1.0,Requires a subscription service to function properly,"  I was actually really happy with these cameras. Easy to understand app and setup, good video quality, pretty nifty all around. That was, until I recieved an email welcoming me to the 14 day free trial of their subscription service.One of the features of this subscription service (for this product that I already purchased) was that with it, the camera will record more than 12 seconds after movement is detected. Meaning if you don't pay for this, you better hope your home invader rapist/burglar shows their face within 12 seconds of showing up! Sincerely, your friends at Wyze :)This is extortion and a scam. The security camera doesn't do the ONE thing it's supposed to for more than 12 seconds at a time. The email doesn't even say how much the subscription service costs while asking me and providing multiple links to sign up to it.Really sucks because it was good up until that one ""feature."" Now it's just a plastic piece of junk. I'm returning it immediately."
1.0,Picture quality doesn't matter if it won't stay connected or send notifications,"  The cam setup went exactly as instructed. I set it up and it immediately went offline, but it's in the same room as the router, 10ft away. I rebooted as instructed, and it came online again. For a few minutes. During setup I had been signed up for the free Cam Plus trial with motion notifications, so I tested that but, I did not get any notifications with extreme motion in the camera field of vision. I couldn't really test much because after a few moments, it went offline again. There is nothing wrong with my router, and I do not have a heavy streaming load. There's one tv and one non-gaming laptop usually running on this network.I got this camera for peace of mind when I am away from home. When I am away I can't walk over and unplug/plug in the camera every 20 minutes when it goes offline.  This camera is no good if it does not fundamentally work. Unfortunately I didn't get to unbox and install it until after my return window expired, so I'm stuck with it. I wasted a lot of money on 3 cameras and covers for them. I'm pretty mad at myself for making such a poor choice.It's literally no better than not having a camera. I might as well have just stapled $45 to the wall for each camera I bought. That would provide the same amount of security."
2.0,Better than V2 but not there yet - No tech support,  The V3 picture quality and low light sensitivity is better than the V2 & battery cameras but the motion detection at night is so horrible that I can’t use it.  The camera produces so much noise at night that the motion detection continually triggers at the lowest sensitivity with the sound detection off.  I am averaging over 100 false alarms per night with the cameras.  I have the battery version and the V2 camera looking at the exact same scene and they are producing no false alarms.  I believe I have a defective unit but the customer service is so horrible that I can’t get a response from them.  I keep getting emails apologizing to me that somebody will get back to me soon but 14 days passed with no actions.  I have submitted all of the settings and actual screen shots to tech support and am discouraged by the lack of response. Help!!!!
2.0,Picture quality is great.  The microphone is terrible.  It rarely connects.  Stick to V2,"  3 Month Update:I'll stick to my V2's.  They work all the time and connect quickly.  The v3 is ALWAYS the one cam I get a connection error on when trying to view with the app., almost 100% of the time  It also misses motion events regularly.  The picture is great but the audio is worthless.1 Week Update:The 2 way audio is useless.  When I turn on the speaker so I can listen to what's going on outside, all I hear is a constant, LOUD snap crackle and pop.  Even when someone is standing directly below the camera and yelling, all I hear is snap crackle and pop.  Hopefully the video continues to work.Original review:The picture quality is amazing.  I initially planned on getting just one of these to mount outside (thanks to the new weatherproofing) and because the picture quality is so much better and vastly superior at night, I'll be replacing all of my v2's pretty soon.Here's a bug I didn't expect.  I have this mounted on my garage watching my driveway and front lawn.  I get random notifications that there's a vehicle in my driveway.  Yah, Wyze, I know.  It's been sitting there all day and hasn't moved.  But I keep getting a random notification that there's a vehicle.  It's not saying it moved and there's no movement detected on the camera.The second bug is less a bug and more of a feature failure.  All the new v3's come with 2 weeks of 24/7 continuous recording and in theory it's great and I appreciate the free offer to check it out but I'd REALLY like to turn it off and I can't.  I have GARBAGE internet with God-awful upload speeds.  The 12 second videos aren't much of a problem.  But the much longer videos hoss my internet to the point that the other cams no longer work properly until the v3 video is uploaded.That all being said, I love the new v3's and will be swapping out all my v2's very soon."
1.0,Are these new versions cheaply made or was mine a bust?,"  Big fan of the wyze cams, have a handful of the older versions. Excited to try this new version. Has a good new look, Set up was easy like the originals. HOWEVER within a week it stopped working... no lights, no power, just died. I tried resetting, or using different plugs etc. ...Nothing. Unfortunately I waited awhile after I received it to use it, so I'm also like 3 days out of the return policy now. I'm obviously not going to shell out another $40 to give it a second chance. Pretty unsatisfied customer to say the least."
1.0,Great the first night-stopped working the 2nd night,"  We used it as a monitor in our daughter’s room. The camera worked really well the first night. We were very impressed with the quality of images.  The next night when I turned it on, there was a message that there is a firmware update. I tried doing the firmware update and it tried updating all night and it just kept updating and never stopped (after 8 hours). I followed the troubleshooting guide and unplugged it, plugged it back in and nothing. I switched outlets and plugs as the troubleshooting directions happened and nothing. I tried deleting the camera from the app and deleting the app and reinstalling and nothing."
1.0,V3 is now ONLY a CLOUD cam- no local access.  How disappointing.,"  I read lots and lots of reviews on the ""Wyze Cam"" without really paying too much attention to v2 vs. v3.  But I should have!  v2 has ""RTSP"" support- which means you can connect to it from your local network or 3rd party apps like tinycam without going through the Wyze cloud.  BUT- they KILLED THAT FUNCTIONALITY for the v3!!!  Reading out on the Wyze forums, it seems like this functionality was promised LAST FALL (it's now almost Fall one year later!) but WYZE hasn't delivered.  How sad.  I'll be returning this useless-to-me piece of scrap metal."
5.0,Best and Easiest Surveillance EVER !!,
1.0,WORSE than POOR Wifi capabilities,"  I have a dual band, 2.4/5 Ghz wifi router that sits ~30', with direct line of sight (NOTHING in between the router and the wifi cam) and the crappy $30 cameras will not stay connected. These are useless for anything. I bought 4 ea. and set them up in the living room, and 1 at the front door (30' away with line of sight to the wifi router) and none of them would stay connected. I was always seeing them disconnected, all times of the day and night; what good are they to my family if they won't stay connected via wifi?!Sad part was Wyze support was NO SUPPORT and could not get them to even respond over a week+ period of time with anything other than WE WILL GET BACK TO YOU, THANKS FOR YOUR EMAIL. Stay away from these cameras and stay away from wifi cameras, just wire them in, unless they are extremely temporary and you do not need to rely on them for anything other than having a dummy camera setup.I DO NOT recommend these for anyone wanting even a most rudimentary camera system."
2.0,"Great image quality, but comes with too many faults / strings","  The jump in image quality from the V2 camera to the V3 camera is amazing.  What is also amazing, but not in a good way, are all the faults, and the lack of progress in fixing them.Wyze has released dozens of new products, and makes a big splash with their introduction, but then does nothing to fix the faults in the existing products.Right now, the V3 cameras are _supposed_ to pay attention to a user-defined detection zone in order to cut down on false positives.  However, the forums are full of people complaining that the feature does not work.  I have this problem right now, with dozens of false positives per day making the camera useless for it's intended purpose.Of course, Wyze is happy to solve your problem with the CamPLUS subscription service for $1.25 / camera / month!It's become obvious that Wyze has transitioned from a purveyor of affordable devices to using those devices to sell subscriptions to the services they offer.However,  if you're like me and just wanted a camera that _didn't_ require a subscription service to make it useful, you end up with a decent piece of hardware that is almost useless.They also used to have a sensor system that plugged into back of the (V2) cameras, that hand window and motion sensors that worked just fine.  Now you gotta spend $5/mo plus an up front HW cost for a ""home monitoring service"".It's hard to tell if they had all this in mind at the outset, or if the economics of their situation (as they have stated) did force them to push all these subscription services, but in the long run, it just blows what was originally a pretty good idea.Another downside, and this is a byproduct of their push to sell subscription services, is that Wyze products do not support integration with any other home automation systems, especially open source ones like OpenHab, Home Assistant, etc.I think if they just limited their focus fewer products, they could afford to fix the problems and not have to push the subscription model so much."
5.0,I purchased 7 cameras...,"  After installing these at my house and using them for a few months here are the overall pros/cons I've experienced:Pros: At this price there is nothing better. Believe me, I've wasted a lot of time/money with other cameras in the $25-$35 range and these V3's are the best for the price. Very easy to install. Since they don't weigh much 1 screw is all that's needed per camera. They look modern/sleek. Video quality during the day and at night with is good (not excellent). Don't expect to be able to see any license plate numbers beyond 10 feet from the cameras because that won't happen. I'm glad users can turn off the very visible blue yes, blue light on each camera. Wyze...what the heck were you thinking when you chose that color? LOL...stick with what has and will forever look best for cameras...red status light! I'm in the central valley of California and temperatures have recently been near 100 and the cameras haven't had any overheating issues. Person detection and push notifications of persons detected works great and is worth the $2.00/per month per camera charge. I have the most entry level standard wifi plan with AT&T and person notifications arrive on my iPhone in about 10 seconds.Cons: Since only 1 screw holds these cameras they can easily be stolen in less then 5 seconds. Not joking. All it takes is one good pull and the camera + the sd card inside (if you put one in) are gone. With the exception of person detection that works great all other notifications (package, cars, motion etc) are ABSOLUTELY HORRIFIC. It doesn't matter what sensitivity setting you chose or what zones you have set if you don't turn OFF all these notifications (except persons) you'll be very upset with the detection capabilities. Wyze really needs to work on their zone and sensitivity settings. Setting zones and sensitivity levels is useless because even if something is out of the zone or on sensitivity level 1 (lowest) I still receive tons of false notifications. This is why I only have person detection on. It's really the only reason why I have a paid subscription.Overall...for the price I can't give this less then 5 stars and CNET, PC Magazine, Editors Choice etc agree. No other company is able to deliver a camera like this at the ridicoulously low price of $25/each. Note, that when these V3 cameras are sold out on the official Wyze site Amazon increases the price to $33 per camera."
5.0,Life saver,
2.0,Worked well when it worked.,"  Really liked it at first. I have a couple wyze cameras. I had purchased it thinking it was wireless, so that was my error, but the cord has a weather seal and it seems ok. The base is magnetic and it's a nice compact camera so it didn't matter since I had a place I could use it. The field of view was nice and wide. It was light weight unit and the stand allowed to be moved to where I needed it to cover. Out of the box, 4 or 5 stars.Why 1 star in the review? It worked for a few days. Now it won't connect to my network at all. I've reset the camera, I've deleted and tried it to reinstall it,, restarted  my network, checked everything... it won't connect work. My other brand cameras and other wyze cameras still connect. This one just stopped.Maybe I just got a dud? I don't know but it's disappointing."
3.0,"Even after 3 firmware upgrades, still several firmware issues need fixing!","  V3 Wider angle lens than V2, less magnification and more fisheye like image distortion.  Very impressive low light sensitivity.Update 07/2021:  firmware updates provided minor improvement.  Cameras still timeout and go offline when connected to ubiquiti mesh access points, requiring power cycling to restore connection. Bought another brand of access points and eliminated mesh network with wires, some camera connection  improvement.  Camera firmware still goes offline due to frequent internet loss at remote rural location requiring power cycling.  Since my cabin is 700 miles away I still have to rely on PG&E frequent outages to reset my cameras. Unacceptable that V1, V2, and V3 cameras go offline and  require power cycling due to frequent internet connection drops  even after mesh network issues removed.  I have personally developed network interface hardware and drivers which could handle these issues so I believe the camera firmware could be improved.Hoping Starlink order filled soon to improve my internet to reduce cameras going offline.  5 months since my deposit for starlink beta...Original review:Firmeare buggy.  Camera Times out and goes offline until power cycled because ubiquiti mesh network nodes go into power save mode, I cant cycle camera power without driving 700 miles to the cabin location.Another serious bug, v3 camers ignore video resolution when set to 360p and self-change to SD resolution. Location has DSL that often benchmarks at 250Kbps down and 80Kbps up, so can only turn on single camera or overload upstream bandwidth.  Camera comes on at SD then tells me network is unstable and i should switch to 360p mode - it was set to 360p until i turned it off and back on.  App or firmware???Also, have to turn off all but 1 of the 10 cameras or network overload causes most to go offline until oower cycled.  Should be able to keep cameras enabled at HD but ONLY recording to local SD so they dont overload network upstream bandwidth.  AS IS, they are USELESS with low bandwidth connections.Another bug: DHCP timeouts because ubiquiti mesh network slow to configure after frequent power outages by PG&E. These could work much more reliably if static IP was an option.  Otherwise camera goes offline until next power outage resets then if lucky comes back online...Wish i could download firmware image to local NFS or SMB share or my phone and verify checksum then push to the multiple cameras, currently each camera fails firmware upsate 3-5 times before successful so to update all 10 cameras takes more than a day with all the retries.Have reported multiple firmware bugs on Wyze support forum without responses.Hopefully firmware will be fixed soon  V2 cameras took a lot of time to fet mostly stable.Hopefully Starlink service will  be offered soon to solve my DSL peoblems.  No other options for internet."
1.0,motion detection broken unless you pay,"  There is a 5 minute deadtime interval after any motion event, during which time it will not identify/record any new motion events., even if you are recording to your SD card. This is a deliberately broken feature, that miraculously goes away if you pay extra for the monthly service.This is not listed on any of the publicity pages, but only found if you go digging for it through their website."
1.0,Why Wyze???,"  First and foremost, it saddens me that I'm writing this review. I have several Wyze products that I LOVE, seriously. Before this purchase, I was a VERY SATISFIED customer. Well, that's now ended after buying the Wyze Cam V3. I purchased one on Amazon and another at Home Depot. The Amazon one has now been returned and I'm not sure about buying another Wyze product for now.  I cannot tell you how many various issues I continue to have with the camera. I will give you a few examples:I. Bought the camera and then purchased cam plus to be able to capture full events. Motion sensitivity for the camera was set at 38 and it was recording events but not the full events. Emailed support, honestly no help at all. I resolved nothing and canceled cam plus. This past weekend it stopped recording events altogether and I had to set the camera to sensitivity 100. It was working on sensitivity 38 with some issues but it was recording events (just not full events). WHAT HAPPENED, WHO KNOWS??2. The camera's night vision and IR were turned OFF. They are now back on, I didn't turn them on.3. I have the camera set to turn off and on at a certain time. It was working fine, now it's recording all day.I have spent so much time attempting to resolve issues and getting nowhere. Support no help and generic assistance. They will tell you stuff like reboot the camera, force close the app. It's starting to sound like I'm going to have to do it DAILY. Just to get it to work as it should! I have a Yi camera that works with no issues. No force closes or constant reboots needed, what gives?Wyze has fallen off with this camera and I'm tired of working so hard trying to get this just to work as it should.It's $32, don't expect much."
1.0,NO SUPPORT!!!,  The camera is okay BUT there is NO SUPPORT! I clicked on a link in my sign up email from 2 weeks ago for support and the page no longer exist!! I purchased a subscription and the app states I have a subscription. To active I have a choice of clicking the camera which sends me to a page to PURCHASE another subscription or click subscription which sends me to a page to PURCHASE another camera! No instructions on how to get the camera and subscription paired. Without the pairing the camera is worthless!
1.0,This is a huge downgrade to original units,"  I have over 10 of these cameras from Wyze. I just got 2 new V3 units. I am utterly disappointed. Are they better in night visition? YES, better picture YESBut, I can't even get these to stream live without buffering like mad on the same wifi network not even viewing from outside the network!!!!! Likewise I can not view playbacks for more than 2-3 sec before buffering for 15sec and playing again for 2-3 sec and having the same thing happen. Seems to have gotten worse with the firmware updates. These are not usable to view what is going on or to see what happened!!!"
1.0,"It's a toy camera, one step up from fake security camera","  If you don't have anything better to do then spend time getting customer support you might like this. Also,if you aren't using the camera for security and you don't care about accuracy then it's ok. The camera/software doesn't know the difference between motion and person. Frequently it won't record at all. You will see a person leave but you didn't see them come in or vice versa. Plus you will have to wade through about 60 motion recordings per hour to see if you can find the person. It is supposed to record persons but it is just as likely to record a person a a motion. It might be difficult to understand what I'm saying - but this camera is not reliable. You will spend hours a week wading through customer support which is not helpful AT ALL. They are so busy releasing crappy new (most likely reseller) products from China that they don't give a damn about improving or supporting the products they already have. You might be able to find a similar camera on Ali Express directly from China. So, if you want a toy so you can randomly watch your cat when it decides to record and you don't care about the quality of the recording, this camera is for you. An additional insult about this product is there is no way to view or manage it from your pc."
4.0,Does a decent enough job for a good price,
3.0,"Worked great for 2.5 months, until Dec 2021 firmware update broke it","  I loved my Wyze v3. Since September 2021, I have used it to record critters in my yard at night. It was fairly easy to set up the rules so that I got notifications at certain time frames, as well as set when the camera turned on/off. I bought CAM Plus so I got recordings of entire motion events, versus only 12 seconds at a time.Unfortunately, the camera didn’t survive the latest firmware update (December 2021). After I updated my camera firmware on December 4, the app started acting up, telling me the camera was off or offline when it was on and recording and sending me notifications. I did all the steps to fix the app issues, deleted the app and reinstalled on my iphone. I then deleted the device on the app. When I tried adding it back, the camera won’t read the QR code. Wyze says it’s firmware related but wanted to get rid of my complaint by giving me a replacement. Giving me a new camera won’t fix the problem because when I upgrade the camera’s firmware, it will turn the new camera into a paperweight. After Wyze support offered no fix to their firmware and kept pushing my warranty replacement (= new paperweight) I called Amazon. The Amazon rep told me other customers are reporting the same issue related to the latest firmware update ruining their Wyzecam v3.Wyze team, please resolve the firmware issue so v3 owners can scan QR codes and use the device again."
1.0,Wyze support is lacking and nonsensical. Avoid unless you want to roll the dice.,"  Long story short, my base station was unpaired while it was off, and this apparently means that it can literally never be connected to wifi ever again. The app lets you do this, which is pretty bad design.It took over a week of back and forth to get to someone who could help, and they did send out a replacement base station. However, now my existing outdoor cam will not pair with the replacement base station, and their response is that this might get fixed sometime in a future update.So Wyze basically knew that the existing outdoor cam would never be able to work with the base station replacement that they sent me. Think about that for a minute. In the meantime, I have an unusable outdoor cam with a 1 year Wyze Plus subscription that prepaid.The camera itself is good, and it has its pros and cons compared to blink and arlo. However, I would absolutely avoid this company if you run into issues and want to get them resolved."
1.0,Motion Detection is Mystifyingly Poor,"  All of these low end surveillance cameras (Wyze, Blink, etc.) have the same issue with motion detection:  they're too smart for their own good.They detect insects buzzing around the lens but miss cars and animals.  Puzzling.The pattern I notice is that the camera doesn't notify my app right away after something gets in front of the lens.  It thinks about it and then decides to preserve the recording then it tells me.A person is typically recognized right away.A car driving towards the camera with it's lights on at night, not so much.Wildlife walking 15 feet in front of the camera typically doesn't register at all.The camera's algorithm seems to be discarding these objects as valid motion.The sun shining in the lens is detected like a mofo though...  or shadows on the ground from the trees...The motion detection needs a lot of work.  Or they need to allow users to tweak the settings so that specific items are not ignored (pure sensitivity settings don't seem to solve the issue).I would argue the motion detection is almost all of the value of these cameras, otherwise it makes more sense to have a traditional camera system that just records all the time."
1.0,Would not stay connected,"  Was very excited to get the new V3 since I own 2 V2's that have performed flawlessly over the past year or so. I was looking forward to the enhanced night time vision. Ordered one and got it configured with no issues. Then put in a memory card and that's when things went south. Disconnected it and even deleted it from the app, but when I tried to re-add it, the camera would never say, ""Ready to connect"" no matter what I did. So I returned it and just got a replacement figuring that I just got a defective one. The second one was just as easy to connect, but after I put the memory card in, it disconnected and I had to take the memory card out to reconnect. So I thought I would just use it without the memory card, and about 2 hours after connecting it back up, it disconnected again. Not reliable enough to keep, so I sent them both back. Will have to wait until they work out the bugs. Once that happens, I'll probably get another one."
1.0,Camera ok but service is bad,"  I bought the camera to watch my second house while I wasn't there, my wife rented it out so I no longer needed the camera. I tried for a half hour to cancel but was never given that option, only got the option to sign up for what I already had. Eventually I was given a phone number for support. After waiting for 15 minutes they answered, I guess they answer from home now because there was so much noise from kids in the background that she couldn't hear me and I couldn't hear her. After 30 minutes she told me they couldn't find my account so it must 3 already be gone. She informed me that if I was charged again I could call back for a refund, but really she ""thought"" I was already cancelled. When I got off the phone I found my account still open on the app, I was able to go thru to Google play store to see that they were still going to charge me when my year was up. But this time i also had a cancel button so I cancelled. I won't use a service that is easy to sign up for but is near impossible to cancel. I was going to use wyze to get protection for my home but this convinced me to look elsewhere."
1.0,"Cheap Price, Cheap Quality","  You get what you pay for. I read so many articles and reviews saying these cameras were good but neglected to read the reviews directly from the app. The cameras are fine, but the software that monitors and alerts is horrible! Their ""AI"" is untrainable and detects every shadow or moving branch as a car or person. If I lower the sensitivity to stop getting false positives it won't even detect me standing directly in front of the camera. I thought if I kept submitting the clips to Wyze to ""help improve AI,"" eventually my labeling for them would help, but nope. I've probably submitted 200 false positives and there's been no improvements. This is significantly worse than the old Ring system I had. In summary, if you want notifications every minute for a gust of wind this is the camera for you. If you want something to accurately notify you when a person or vehicle is present you should spend more to get something high quality. If I were only using it to drop in on a pet if would be fine, but that's about it."
1.0,My recorded events disappear constantly,"  I bought Cam V3 with extra storage card and subscribed to CAM PLUS as well.It records events, but when I go to view them, they all disappear.I called WYZE support and she was totally useless.I kept trying to explain that the camera does sense and record events fine, but they disappear within minutes when I try to view them.All I get is ""No events Records""She never understood that. She kept trying to help me to get it record events.What a dummy.Too late to return the camera.I do not know where the problem is.Could be bad camera but it seems more like a bad App.I am through with WYZE. Going back to RING."
1.0,It's always something with these cheap cams!,"  REVIEW UPDATE:  It always seems like there is SOMETHING with Wyze products!  I think the are so busy pushing out new, sub-par products that they never get anything fully ""right"".  I got a replacement for the dead cam through Amazon..... and now the other two are having issues!  I am using them with TinyCam Pro, in a ""cloud"" setup/setting.  First, if you update the firmware, they simply will not work at all with TinyCam, so had go through the hassle of reverting the firmware to make them work with TinyCam.  Then, every 3 minutes, each camera blanks out for approx. 5 seconds.  Sometimes the camera image pops back up, and other times when it does, TinyCam crashes.  I'm pretty tech savvy, and after looking at the code in the Wyze firmware update, it appears they have intentionally coded the firmware to make the cameras NOT function with anything other than the Wyze app.  Why make a substandard product when it could be so much more?  And why make such a sloppy app, that again, could be so much better??  Wyze is always on the verge of having a superior product for the money, but they always drop the ball in the end.FOLLOW UP:  One of the 3 cameras I received totally died on the 3rd day of use.  Amazon was great about returning it for a replacement, but that should not happen..... so my initial review has dropped from 3 to 2 stars.ORIGONAL REVIEW:This is what the original Wyze Cam should have been in regard to image clarity and night vision. The night vision is superior to any of the other Wyze cameras.  I purchased 3 of these cameras on the same order, and there is an image issue with each.... that being that each camera has a different zone within the onscreen image that is out of focus compared to the rest of the image. (cleaned all the camera lenses after mounting)  One camera has an out of focus area in a strip that runs from the lower right corner of the image, to the upper middle.  Another has a horizontal strip straight across the middle of the onscreen image, and the third has the entire right side of the onscreen image out of focus.  Another VERY annoying thing is that all of these camera go blank on the screen every 3 mins, for approx. 2 seconds, and then return to the image.  This happens like clockwork, with all three of the cameras I received. (I am using TinyCam Pro as the camera image/screen host.)  I found out the hard way that if you upgrade these, or any of the Wyze Cameras to the latest software version, they WILL NOT function with TinyCam Pro.  I had to download, and revert each camera individually to the old software in order for them to function with TinyCam Pro.  These cameras are still likely the best bang for the buck in terms of affordable security cameras, but it feels like Wyze just does barely enough to eek by getting the cameras to sell.  Although the advertising would have you believe otherwise, the only tangible thing you get for paying the extra money for the V3 cameras is the improved night vision, and that is almost offset by the annoyance of the image flash out every 3 minutes, and the out of focus areas within each camera's image."
1.0,Not worth the money unless you subscribe to Cam Plus,"  I used to really like Wyze. I purchased the first version when it first came out. I liked that it recorded to a local SD card.  I now have three older V1 cameras and have upgraded them to V3. I've had problems with all of them.First, the SD card was corrupted on two of then. The card was fine it just stopped working in the camera. I was able to format the SD card and it would work again.Next, the night vision sensor on two of the cameras stopped working.My biggest complaint however is that they limit the camera if you don't purchase their Cam Plus subscription.  Events are limited to 12 seconds of recording time and you can't fast forward the video. There's no reason for this limitation except to milk their customers for more money. To the accountants this makes sense but I HATE IT! I don't want to ever do business with companies that do it. If you do, you're making the world a little bit worse.I've decided to switch to Eufy cameras and will be retiring Wyze.  At this point I don't know enough about Eufy cameras to recommend them but I can definitely recommend avoiding Wyze."
1.0,"WYZE - BAD product, BAD service - Do not purchase this product unless you want to waste your money","  It is impossible to get in touch with WYZE support.  The fact that they are so difficult to contact is a definite NO for this product.  Also, despite following the instructions on activating motion and sound detection, the camera does not send alerts or appear to be properly recording motion and sound.I've watched multiple videos to no avail.  The settings are correct, the camera is crap and you can't contact WYZE support via phone number that you have to google search to find.  In fact, the support call number disconnects after the message that the call volume is high while the music is playing.  A second number that is provided does not list office hours and the voicemail box is full.  Email and chat line is equally disappointing.  Chat line does not indicate hours of operation and no response was received from email to their support mailbox.In order to setup the camera, I was required to buy a 1-year annual cloud service.  Apparently, you cannot cancel this service even though you did not actually want to purchase it.  I tried to cancel within minutes of paying only to find out that there is no way to cancel via Apple bill, PayPal and NO Refunds.I would NOT recommend any product from this company."
5.0,Good price - impressive picture,"  Needed a camera to watch the dog when it was in another room.The Wyze v3 was inexpensive so I thought I would give it a try.It is very nice.  A nice set of features.  Good picture (on an iphone 8plus it is as sharp as if I was standing in the room) .  Good night vision (in color depending on how dark it is).  Two way talk.  Live streaming.  Video playback.  The phone app has a nice set of features too.  The phone app also has 2 factor authentication (YEAH!!  All apps should!!  don't let the hackers into your IoT because they stole or guessed your password!) - though it isn't token or authenticatorApp based...still way better than just a password.I read somewhere that the event captured videos used to go through China servers (though they were encrypted) but more recently I read that Wyze changed that so all video from US cameras stay in the US.  If that worries you, check into it - don't take my word on it.I also bought a Micro SD card (from Amazon of course) so the continuous video recording stays on the device (on the SD card):  SanDisk 32GB MAX Endurance microSDHC Card with Adapter for Home Security Cameras and Dash cams - C10, U3, V30, 4K UHD, Micro SD Card - SDSQQVR-032G-GN6IA  : https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B084CJLNM4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1It holds about 4 days worth of continuous video in the camera.  The continuous video on the SD card is accessible via the app (and the app servers are in the cloud like everything else) but is supposed to be end-to-end encrypted.I think motion alerts are part of the subscription package ($20 a year per camera) but I'm not using those so I don't know for sure.  From what I could tell, all cameras are now charging a subscription fee.  There is no fee to record to the local SD card.  (The SD card has to be formatted FAT32 so Wyze claims the camera  can only support cards up to 32GB.  Some people online have said they managed to get cards as high as 128GB to work.  I don't know anything about that.  If that is important - then you should check into it).I liked the camera so much, that I just bought another one and it should be arriving any minute now!"
4.0,Love these v3 Cams...with a couple of irritations.,"  Love these v3 Cams...with a couple of irritations. I now have 11 of these installed outside and inside our home, having replaced all of the older gen cams from other brands (Arlo, Blink, etc.) I feel like I'm finally satisfied with my security surveillance between the Ring alarm and these cams. I have just a couple of minor irritations which I hope will resolve as Wyze evolves the firmware and the software of the app: (1) The so-called ""Detection Zones"" actually do...NOTHING! I have used them for the past few months to try to remove tree limb and shadow motion from the detection zones of some of the outside cameras, and I can't see that they do anything at all. I've read all of the forum posts about this, and my conclusion is that they do nothing at all. I have the latest firmware as of August 12, 2021. Motion is still detected in the excluded zones even though I have taken care to make the detection zones oversized in every case. Maybe future firmware will actually allow detection zones to work. (2) The Android app (current as of August 12, 2021) DAILY needs to be force-stopped and restarted to get the cameras to load live video. Sometimes, more than once daily. I can't relate it to anything but the cameras/app. WiFi signal strength is consistently measured very high at all locations (I have TP-Link Deco 9 mesh) and my broadband is Gigabit service (measured.) Restarting the app works in 99% of the instances, but I have one or two cams that have required a power reset. Overall, though, I can say that I am very happy with my system now. With the Arlos, in particular, it seems I would leave town on a trip and within a couple of days the Arlo hub would be offline with no one home to do a power reset, so the cams were useless for the entire time I was away. With Wyze v3 cams, that has never happened. I do have Cam+ on all of these cameras, since I got a deal for unlimited for hundred bucks a year. The Cam+ features need some work too, but Wyze seems committed to improving those features. I do have SD cards in all of the cams, and I love the ability to watch back in the app from the SD cards when I want to see a time period just prior to or just after a cloud recording event. I have never been satisfied with my WiFi cam experience until now, and seriously considered going to the expense of pulling wire through the attic for an Ethernet/Hard Drive system before trying the Wyze cams. I'm happy, and I avoided the drudgery and expense of pulling all that wire. I also like the ability to key a camera siren from the app for a few seconds if I want to. I've used this mostly to get animals off the porch and/or patio."
1.0,Not Worth the Money,"  I just want to focus on what was lacking in the setup procedure.  The quick guide does not give any clues on how to extend the base.  Do I just pull as hard as possible and hope for the best, is there a release button?  I did resort to pulling the base from the camera, and nothing broke.  The base on this unit was very tight, which may be a good thing in the long run.  There is no explanation on the use of nor how to insert the SD card.  It took two tries to get it oriented correctly.  However, I have not been able to find a setting for accessing the card.  The Wyze website is useless in addressing these issues.  After using the camera for two weeks, I can say it is not the product I expected.  First, I have not been able to get a sound notification, which is really useful and necessary.  Second, after the trial period expires, the recorder is set to record for 12 seconds.  During the trial period, it can vary from 24 and up.  So, the purpose is to get you to buy a subscription to their service.  There is a very minute drawing for inserting the SD card, but it is really small.  I had to use a flashlight, angled just right in order to see it.  This is a very disappointing product.  Update:  after the trial period lapsed, the camera recorded only a still image for each event.  As noted by others, the camera then waits five minutes to record anything else.  The playback speed is limited to X1 for events you watch on your phone.  My Samsung Galaxy S10 does not make a sound for notifications, unlike my dog who is great at notifications.  All in all a completely useless device for home security, unless you want to give Wyze some more of your money."
1.0,"""Works with Alexa"" is a lie","  Updated V3 to the latest firmware 4.36.0.280. Still getting the message on Alexa ""Wyze - Live mode not supported"" which means your Alexa show devices will NOT work. Using ""Alexa show me the camera"" tries to connect, tries again, and fails. I cannot use the camera for its intended use. Contacting wyze support was not possible. Sat waiting for chat for hours. Then they showed up in chat for 6 seconds and dropped me. I have the full transcript of this. Works ok (not great) with their app so I will probably keep it anyway."
3.0,"First cam, but with some issues","  Been using it for few weeks and so far so good, but it does have some flaws.Set up was really easy.  Download the app, follow the instructions and within less then 5 minutes I had mine set up.Although it is 1080p HD, the quality can be a bit blurry.  So far I have not been able to make out the license plates but I knew it wasn't going to give me crisp clarity on the image for $30+ device.  All I needed was to detect people and cars which is perfect for that.Now for night vision, I have to give it thumbs up.  Matter of fact, the night vision seems to give more details then the daylight vision in my eyes and it looks great.I have two cam and at first I set up only one cam with the cable that came with the box and the responses time on the app was quick but after connecting the other cam with the 20ft cable, it does lag a little bit as others have mentioned but eventually I got used to it.Audio  This is where it has one of it's flaws.  If you raise the volume up, you can definitely hear a static noise or white noise (as many have mentioned on forums).  I don't think it interferes with the receiving end as when I speak people can hear it clearly without the static noise but on my phone I can hear it and the problem seems to be unsolved as there are many forums and complaints online regarding this.Memory.  When you set it up it offers you two weeks cloud for free so you can try it out and upgrade to Camplus with a small fee.I went for the 32 GB microSD card which is the best way for me.  A site mentioned that you can go higher capacity as well.  This allows all videos to be recorded on the SD card 24/7.  I think I can go full 4 days max in HD which is not a problem as I can always transfer the recording to my phone with the app right away.Notification isn't too bad but most times I get notified quick (between 5-10 sec) but other few times it can be up to 30 sec and up.Overall it is a cheap cam that works well besides few minor things that I mentioned.The app is easy to use with the functions that I need are all there from sensitivity level to covering open areas for detection notice.The audio issue made me think about returning it, but I'm going to hold onto it and see if any future update will be able to fix it."
5.0,Perfect camera for DIY home security,
1.0,Glitch City,"  I've had this camera set up for about a week.  It has the newest firmware installed and the newest Android app being used to monitor it.  I can view the video stream for 30 seconds at most before it just stops streaming video.  It doesn't matter if I have it in HD, SD, or 360p streaming mode.  It doesn't matter if I have a strong 4G, 5G, or wifi connection.  It just freezes 100% of the time.  Restarting the app restarts the stream, but then it freezes again 30 seconds later.  It's inexcusable in this day and age for a company of this size to have a product performing so poorly right out of the box."
1.0,Garbage and bad customer service,  Cameras are junk and fail to connect or freeze all the time. The Cameras say they have 100% signal yet you can't watch live stream or play back without it freezing. Customer service is horrible too. I have wyze cam 2 Cameras which are okay and I bought two of the cam 3 and bought cam plus licenses but only 2 were activated. Tried to get another license for the 3rd camera and it deactivated the two other licenses. Contacted wyze and they were useless and took over 60 dollars for three one year subscriptions to cam plus and said there's nothing they could do. I returned the Cameras and I will never buy another wyze product again.
5.0,Great Cams for the money,  Used a few of these V2 and V3 for 2 of my houses. I opted for these cause the plug in power over battery/solar. Can also purchase online extended micro usb cables 20ft to 100ft if needed. Another plus was the video playback option with sd card slot. Don't need to pay a monthly/yearly subscription for video playback. Only thing is after your card starts filling need to start removing files you don't need. Motion detection without the upgrade can be a problem. Headlights at night to bugs to trees/leaves can set it off. The v3 plus upgrade can help with that. If not leave it as is and just get the alerts. So on a daily need to be checking and clearing files if you got a small Gig card. Clarity not the greatest when zooming in but when people are up close easily identifiable! Sound MIC all work like most cam/doorbells.
5.0,Best mini Camera i have ever purchased.,"  I had ordered another camera, and it did not  live up to my expectation.  So I returned it back to Amazon, I hear about this one from a friend and decided to get one.  It is small easy to install and it gives me the option of adding a SD card to the bottom of it.  I can talk if someone is in my home and tell them they being recorded etc.  Or if the kids are home I can monitor them without them knowing.  I decided to hide my camera inside a small bird house that i purchased in the dollar store.  The top of the house opens up so I was able to put it there,  it come with a round metal plate that i glued to the inside of the bird house and sleep in the camera, covering up the camera with lollipop sticks.  It is awesome, i will purchase for family and friends who need that added security...  I will paint the house later on, but it works for me...Thank you"
1.0,Horrible camera & service,"  Do not buy this for home security- Apparently their AI deletes  or crops all persons or people alert from you events on recording so that they can charge you for something that was a not an issue when we first started using the wyze cam few years back. They downgrade their software or camera features with every update and come up with a subscription plan for deleted features, soon they will lose all customers. Simple motion detection recording from 3 years back had more useful alerts than the one with new current ""AI"".( axxhle intelligence, lol) Strong pass as a home security camera as its definitely pointless to get these for that purpose. Stay away!"
5.0,They took something good and made it better,"  These things are phenomenal.  An SD card is a must -- get the 32GB Microcenter one on Amazon for $5, and you have a $40 camera.  I have 2 Nest cams and a nest Hello doorbell, but I can tell you that when those die, I will be switching my whole ecosystem to Wyze.  I can just point out a few differences in features.  Both apps are very nice, with Nest maybe taking just a little bit of an edge on the look and feel - it lets you ""scrub"" through video.  On the other hand, the Wyze app seems to respond faster.  That's probably due to the fact that the Wyze cam has its own storage.  Nest, even with the $6 subscription, does not record EVERYTHING anymore -- as of a few years ago, even the subscription service will only records events.  And without that $6/month subscription, you get ZERO history with nest, which is a big negative.  Wyze gives you 14 days history of 12 second events on the cloud for free, on top of the constant recording to the SD card.  The Nest app has a very polished UI now, but it is not without issues.  It often freezes and kicks you out of the app.  Nest cameras are $130 a piece.  Nest gives you a website that you can visit from your computer to view the video feeds -- this is sort of an artifact leftover from when they were ""Dropcam""... it's nice, but I can count on one hand the number of times I've used that in 5 years.  It's easier to store captured video directly to your phone with Wyze -- you just start watching the video you want and press the record button while it's playing.. .then stop when you want to stop.  With nest, you navigate to the video you want in the app, then you click ""save clip"" and it just sort of saves a minute or two of video near that time -- but it is really not precise.  As far as video quality, the Nest cams are good, but the Wyze V3 is even better.  Night vision, even without infrared lights is unbelievably good on the Wyze.  Also, Nest disabled the ability to turn off the status light.  They probably did this in the name of some ""privacy policy,"" but if you're sleeping in a room with the camera, you don't want that light.  Also, if you have the camera looking through a window, you don't want the reflection of the light.  Thumbs up to Wyze for keeping this feature available.  I also had a Blink mini for a few weeks - it came free with some other Amazon purchase.  The blink looked and felt cheap.  I plugged it in and found the Blink app to be such total garbage, I actually threw the blink cam in the trash can.  The Wyze cam is so much better than Blink, it's not even funny --- I plan to buy the upgraded Wyze Pro doorbell when that comes out and the Wyze floodlight when I can get it as well...  I really hope Wyze keeps the positive momentum on their products..."
5.0,Great cheap and easy to set up,  Very happy with the camera. The image quality is great. The app is very intuitive and functional. The price point of the Wyze cams are unmatched vs competition. I’ve had the v3 here for a couple months now and thinking of swapping out a v2 with one of these because it’s just a better image. The camera in just a short time has proven to be highly effective at capturing proof of some incidents(mostly rude delivery drivers that have thrown my package and broke them). Also it has come in handy because it is so small and almost unnoticeable I had a minor incident with a neighbor which denied they were at fault. When I pointed to the camera and asked if they’d like to watch the video they quickly apologized and payed for the item in my yard their child broke.
2.0,So far not so good,"  UPDATE: Three weeks of use and not much improvement over usless notifications.I subscribed for 1 yr of AI to help alleviate the shadows of trees and passersby triggering notifications.Shadows of people walking by still trick the AI into a ""person"" notification.Also the notifications are at least a minute or more late from when the action took place.A vandal can do a lot in a minute.I probably won't re-subscribe to the AI service.I'll probably turn off notifications and just let it record 24/7 and supplement it with a simple motions sensor when I find one.Its a good cheap camera for viewing but the notifications didn't work for me...........................................................................It’s only been 2 days so maybe an updated review will add or subtract a star.Worked ok during the day.Noticed a car pull in the driveway.Noticed me cutting the grass.Didn’t notice a delivery person who was pretty quick.At night it alerted every time the lighting changed from passing cars or shadows from tree limbs on the driveway.  This is not good.Brought the sensitivity down to 20% to make it stop but then it didn’t notice me in the driveway.I really wanted this so I could keep an eye on my car at night.I’m not sure I can make it work.A motion sensor would probably be better.You can’t customize the alert sound.It uses your devices default notification sound"
5.0,Best value for my money!,"  I've given away my Blinks to a friend that added them to her system. While Wyze isn't perfect (none are) the value for my dollar is the best I've found, especially with the new V3 night vision! It is utterly amazing.When I bought my first Wyze, I got 3 for just a little more than adding one more Blink. I'd found that for security use, the Blinks needed full time USB power as even lithium batteries in freezing weather failed before spring thaws. My garage and shed are not heated, so it was frustrating to have to change batteries when the temps were single digits! It was a simple change to install Wyze where Blinks were, and at the low price I covered much more of my property inside and out for way less than any other system I'm aware of.Then the V3 came out. I preordered 3 and deployed them under my eaves. OMG they are so awesome! No longer guess what I'm seeing, The city light pollution is enough to light up without the IR lights, but with them it is amazing their range. And color well into and beyond dusk. Very high definition for such a small inexpensive unit.Due to the fact that I have so many cameras deployed now, I found that my WIFI needed a couple mesh extenders to provide reliable service. You may find that need as well if there's a lot of WIFI interference on 2.4GHz in your area. The small case doesn't allow for much of an antenna, and is a common problem for most small wifi cameras without external whip antennas.Ok, so order one and give it a try. If it nags you to update the firmware, skip that. If what it ships with works, leave it alone. There have been some buggy releases recently it seems, but stock firmware has been solid for me. I'm sure they will iron out the bugs, if not already done so."
5.0,Best camera I have because of the starlight feature,
1.0,Too unreliable to give it a good rating.,"  I have several Wyze cams.  They are all constantly breaking.  One day notifications work, next day they don't.  Currently going on two weeks with notifications for non-CamPlus events not working.  On top of that, as of this morning, all my cams seem to have stopped recording any sound events.They were being recorded until 9:41 this morning, then out of the blue, no more sound events on any of my cams.And my newest V3 has also stopped recording motion events, both regular motion and AI (Cam Plus) events.  Nothing.  I can watch it live but it no longer records events.I currently have 7 Wyze cams, a combination of V3, V2, and Cam Pan.  When they work, they are fine, but Wyze has software and server issues far too often, in many cases they are unable to fix them for weeks.Long story short, my 7 Wyze cams, as I type this are all but useless.If you want ""cheap"" and can deal with the devices and software constantly breaking, often with no foreseeable fix coming up, these are great.  But if you need reliable cameras that aren't always breaking, I'd give any Wyze cam a hard pass."
5.0,Great quality and features for a great price!,
1.0,Impossible to connect to regular wifi,"  Apparently some people can get this to work, but it seems there are some compatibility issues with either the app or with certain home wifi routers that make it impossible to connect. You cannot view the camera on your phone without connecting to wifi, but the connection timed out every time I tried setting it up. (The app actually says it's connected during set-up but then spends several minutes saying it's completing the set-up, only to then say the wifi has timed out and that I have to start over).You can put use a microSD card to record without wifi, but that was not what I wanted (the picture quality is great, though). I messaged directly with the company every day for about 2 weeks and used tips from online boards, but nothing that was suggested worked. It should not be this hard to set up a basic home security camera. For what it's worth, I'm pretty tech-saavy, use tech regularly for my job, and often help friends or family with tech-related questions. Finally they sent me a new one, but that didn't work either. Maybe you'll get lucky, but I'm frustrated that I wasted so much time and wish I had tried something else."
2.0,"Camera is good, software is not usable :(","  I loved this camera… even though it took like 3 days for me to connect properly for some reason, but once it was set up the picture quality was excellent.Issue #1: bandwidth - Unfortunately, it sucks up so much bandwidth (we have 1 step down from fiber & it is very fast for video uploads/etc) we can’t use it consistently because my partner & I both work from home. Our simplisafe camera doesn’t have this issue.Issue #2 - premium doesn’t connect intuitively. I tried the free trial for premium & it never worked right, but paid to upgrade anyway as I was on vacation when the trial expired & wanted to keep an eye on my house - it charged me for 1 camera, then said I needed to upgrade my second waze camera so I did, & it then double-charged me for the first. After clicking accept/activate in like 4 places, it still won’t record past 12 seconds. The screen STILL asks if I want to activate after clicking yes several times. Good thing we didn’t get a break in, upgrading wouldn’t have helped.Issue #3: frustration with customer service. I’ve put in a few hours of shadow work at this point so I was pretty frustrated post-vacation, so I waited a bit then contacted support. They said that for security reasons they don’t know what cameras I have (you can’t check my billing?), & they can’t just fix their software issues from their end - I have to troubleshoot it all for them… so yeah, I’m done. There are many other solutions out there & I’ve never had so many issues with this kind of product.Issue #4: too many updates. There have been several firmware & software updates over 3 weeks, & some require you to be near the cameras… how does that work if you’re away on vacation & can’t be near the camera? Can these not be used on the same firmware longer than a few days? I JUST got these, how many updates can there freggin be?Just too many pain points. This product would be great, but seems the software is not ready for customer use. Seems their QA process needs work, which brings security/privacy into question too. I’m not into having a camera in my home by a company that doesn’t have its most basic customer-facing software sorted/solid. I wanted to avoid paying so much for another simplisafe camera, so maybe this is just the cost of a cheaper product.Not a realistic solution though (it’s not cheaper/a good value if it doesn’t work), so unfortunately I’m returning both cameras :("
4.0,Bit Buggy But Brilliantly Budget Priced,"  Meh, couldnt get another 'B' word at the end of the headline.  Many reviews are accurate in some of the criticisms, but overall this is a pretty great budget camera.-  Android Emulators:  for those that want to view this on their desktop, it DOES work.  I used Blue Stacks and its fine.- Connectivity: set up in a few minutes.  The next day my internet went off/on, and for some reason despite the company saying the camera automatically reconnects, it did not.  Took a while to get it reconnected.  This is going to be a deal breaker if it requires complete setup anytime it loses connection, but so far just once and fine since then.-  Moisture Resistant:  have had mine get wet, and have a humidifier in a grow-tent pointing at it and the tent accidentally even going bonkers and reaching 90 degrees and 85% humidity and issues.-  Time Lapse:  This is one of the main reasons I bought this over other security cams, because I wanted one that could record and create timelapse videos , and this did it perfectly.  You can customize the date to start/end, and the interval period for photographs (1 second to as long of a gap as you want).-  App:  this is where I noticed the most buggy-ness. It ALWAYS flickers and stutters when trying to view or switch functions.  The live feed occasionally freezes/pauses which is odd b/c the camera is just feet away from the wireless router.  It ultimately does what I want, but not elegantly or smoothly.  Hopefully future software updates will rectify this.-  Other functions:  I have not yet tried various routines or custom actions or motion tracking yet, so can't speak to those specifically.  Will experiment more and update if any issues.For the price and many functions it offers, most that I don't need, it's plenty great."
3.0,Constant disconnects after accessing the camera from Wyze app seemingly better,"  UPDATED:  This is my 3rd Wyze V3 and this camera works like a charm.  Seems like the early production units had some kind of problem as this one actually works well.  Used both the initial loaded firmware and upgraded firmware and both work.  The latest firmware also supports exfat for the Micro SD card, which will enable larger sizes of cards.ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have been a Wyze customer for 4 years and have Cam V2 and Cam Pan devices, which are very reliable albeit with lower image quality than the Cam V3.The Cam V3 is completely unreliable. If you access it 2 or 3 times from the Wyze app, it locks up and you cannot access it again until you power cycle the Cam V3.  This performance was achieved after taking all of the firmware updates.I also noticed that the Cam V3 has 5GHz WIFI functionality in the hardware (as it can detect my 5Ghz WIFI networks), but in software Wyze only allows you to use the slower 2.4Ghz band. Come on man!The camera looks pretty and the image quality is great, but it is a useless device because it constantly locks up."
4.0,"Waterproof, SD Local Storage, 1080p, Easy Setup - Great Value.","  I've only had these cameras for a few days now, so this may be preemptive, but so far impressed. I set up 6 of these. I've ordered 6 more. Setup is stupid easy. Picture quality is good - albeit 2K would be a big jump over the 1080p offered here. These are replacing a 720p NVR IP Camera system I used for 3 years. Unfortunately, the range on my old system was not adequate for my new living situation. When viewing these cameras individually they connect quickly, updates are real-time, and quality is quite good. Viewing angle seems to be wider than advertised which is good, I compared these to several competitors (Kasa, Blink, Yi) before landing on these as the solution. What sets these apart is two things - SD Card local storage and most importantly IP68 Waterproofing for outdoor use. For the money, these simply cannot be beat. One problem, if you try viewing multiple cameras at once they seem to get overwhelmed with network traffic and real-time viewing degrades considerably. Not really a big deal, but not ideal. 64GB of SD Card storage looks like it will store about 1 week of video - plenty in my opinion. These are nicely built and compact. Night vision is pretty good. Certainly not worth spending 3x the price on competitors cameras that offer the same or worse features."
5.0,It may seemed a little complicated but it's not it's a high-quality product.,"  Got this today, I must say I am extremely thrilled. I got an SD card for it simple to do, even Googled how to remove the SD card put it back in just so I would know, it was all very simple. After couple weeks if this is still doing really great for me I will be ordering more. It has a lot of good features like a siren it does live stream which I adore, connected it to my Alexa, Echo Dot and my old Google Chrome I just Googled everything and it was simple. The picture is extremely good quality with great warmth I'm thrilled with that I haven't checked out the night vision yet but I am sure with everything else that I'm thrilled about the night vision will be just as good thank you Wyze.. I had tried another camera that should have been this simple but it was a nightmare of problems all to find technical support told me it was defective, with my anxiety you saved me Wyze I am so very grateful. A big thank you Amazon for carrying this product at an very affordable price. It may seem complicated but this is not reach out to support and also Google questions and keep looking till you find it. Oh and one more thing very important and looking for how to turn my volume up I found YouTube videos but their app was nothing like my app that I have from Google Play so I found that the first live video where I tested my camera in my app the picture of it I just held my thumb down for a few moments and then it brought up the settings wheel in the right hand corner and I was able to take care of everything from there something important to know."
1.0,"Rubbish for support on faulty unit ,Wize Cam v 4 .","  We lost internet due to storms .When it was restored this cam would not reconnect My Wayze outdoor cam did and three other cameras did no problem. I contacted customer support and after a bit was given a third party app to run ,it gave me a code that I returned from Wyze email per instructions . I guess that is how one gets out of replacing a faulty product , To me support should be walk through set up and when that fails and the unit is faulty a new unit should be sent or at least tell the customer you are out of luck and not waste their time for days .Units may be fine support rubbish ."
3.0,Worth $30?,"  My experience with the Wyze cam v3 has been spotty.  At first it didn't work well, then for no reason it started working as it should...no changes to settings??  I either wasn't getting alerted or alerts were late, very late as much as an hour after detection.  Then I just left it alone thinking if I should just return it as it may not be worth the frustration.  Then after forgetting about it for a day or so it started working as designed...?? For now, after 2 weeks I get the motion detection and alerts within about 20 secs of detection.  I do still get alerts with no video clips, but I found a way around it by going into 'View Playback' and it will be there.  I'm still waiting on customer support from 2 weeks ago when it wasn't working... I'd say customer support isn't really there....but for a $30 security cam what can you expect.  The setup is easy and the settings are pretty easy to figure out with a google/Youtube search. This is my backup system to my Amazon Blink security.  I wanted a corded powered camera as a backup to my Blink system.  My Blink system has been on for 1.5 years now and has had to be restarted, or reset twice as a camera goes offline.If it was my primary system I may return it, but as a $30 backup system...?  I think I'll keep it and may even buy a couple more cameras for the side and back yards...problem is providing power."
1.0,Don't waste your time or money,"  The picture quality is fine, but with sensor turned all the way down, still sends alerts when the wind blows or a bird flies by. The design failed to meet my needs for coverage. Don't try to put it in a window on the right. It won't tilt that way. Worst of all, though, is that the MOST important features are missing in the software. I can't save an event or erase one that somehow got saved (how it saved is a mystery!). TECH SUPPORT IS NON-EXISTENT. It's automated and the answers it provides have NOTHING AT ALL to do with the issue. NOTHING! NOTHING! ""Live chat"" is also automated. It just keeps telling you to rephrase your question over and over. A phone call to them puts you on hold for un unspecified amount of time because they're experiencing a higher than normal volume. I'll bet they are. I'm sending this piece of crap back. Seriously. Save yourself the aggravation and don't buy from these people. ALSO  the software tells me there's no SD card when there clearly IS."
3.0,"Camera initially didn't work with SD card, no way of getting live tech support.  UPDATED","  UPDATED REVIEW:  I was able to get the camera functioning with a SD card finally, after trying several brands. So I'm upping it to 3 stars. Still pretty anemic WIFI reception though, so I wasn't able to use it where I'd hoped. In general, the WyzeCams have been impressive, but so far I'm not all that impressed with the V3.________________________________________________Original Review:Say, I bought this and didn't get around to putting it up until after the month-long amazon return window.Big mistake.It won't work with a 32gb SD card, which was my intended use for it, and guess what... if you go to their ""support"" site you don't get a human, you just get sent to a database of useless questions and answers which do nothing to change the fact that they shipped me a piece of inoperable junk.I had been relatively impressed by the V2 wyze, despite some issues, but feel suckered by this purchase. Nice quality control, ""wyze"". And in theory I have a year warranty, but there is no way on their site to submit a warranty claim that I can see.  So I guess the ""affordable price"" comes at the cost of ""any recourse"" when they ship you a lemon.I'd recommend steering clear."
3.0,"Good cam at great price, but connection issues and purposely hobbled software","  I bought a single Wyze Cam v3 to test out because they are so cheap I figured why not. For the past two months it was working pretty good. Then all of a sudden I realized one day I was not getting motion alerts when I left my house in the morning (cam facing my house front/driveway). I checked the cam and it was offline. I came home and tried to set the camera back up from scratch, but I have been unable to get it to connect to my home wifi ever since. Every other device in my home still connected and working just fine (phones, laptops, printers, smart tvs). No clue what the issue is and not going to bother with it any further. Somewhat stupidly the Wyze support page suggests I ""Forget all WiFi networks, restart your phone."" Yeah, I want to manually re-gather and re-enter every single wifi password I use on my phone -- no thanks.Before the connection died the cam worked pretty well BUT I hate that Wyze purposely limits its capabilities in the effort to get you to subscribe to Cam Plus monitoring services, which ""unlocks premium features"" such as person, vehicle, and pet detection. I don't really care about these so wasn't going to bother, but then Wyze also institutes a ""cooldown"" period in between motion recording events. So if the cam sees motion it will record for 12 seconds, but then it will stop recording new events for 5 minutes. This is just stupid because I am already recording 24/7 and saving to the SD card anyhow so if I want to see past the 12 seconds that was recorded as an ""Event"" I can, but doing so is a pain as I have to go to the livestream playback and rewind to an exact moment. Rewinding can only be done by scrolling with your finger along the timeline and it is very difficult to hit an exact minute (or second); there is no fine-tuning of the rewind function.I want to love this thing especially since it's so cheap and the quality is pretty good (great night vision), but between Wyze purposely hobbling an otherwise good device and the recent unresolved connection issues I simply can't recommend it anymore."
5.0,I would buy more,"  This is a very good camera and it’s cheap, even when you add a memory card and a longer usb cord, for charging. I have cameras all around my house.  Out previous setup was arlo pro and blink. The blinks all died within one week of each other. The arlo are fine but out of date. All were hard wired for continuous charging. I decided that wire free cameras are nice until the battery dies and I need to get on a ladder.I bought the Wyze v3 and have replaced all the blinx and 2/3 of the arlo. What’s not to like for total cost of less than $50 in/camera? The cameras are a lot more responsive and accurate than the other brands and the app is quick.My set up is each camera has an sd card installed as well as continuous power. The cameras all continuously records and I get alerts based on activity zones, I have set up. The cameras are on a wireless mesh network with 84 other devices and no hub is needed. So far, zero issues.The camera has a built in mount and can be positioned in a multitude of positions. It comes with all the mounting options you need. Basically it requires 1 screw to be installed and your good.Mounting is critical. I suggest you mount it high enough where it cannot be ripped down. Mine are all at least 12 feet high, under the roof overhangs and have the flat wire usb painted to match the house."
2.0,Pretty good camera actually but company is acting shady with free cloud storage,"  It pains me to write this review because I really wanted this company to be true.  3 Years ago, I started looking for an alternative to DVR/NVR camera systems and of course the big names would pop up -Ring & Nest. The problem was neither of them offered local storage and their cloud storage had a subscription fee of around 12 bucks a month for unlimited devices and their cameras were expensive.Then I heard of WYZE cameras- They had V2 cameras for 25 bucks and allowed for a microSD card and 12 second (5 minute cooldown) cloud storage which would be nice in case SD card would malfunction or someone would steal the camera.  As an added bonus, there was person detection built in too!  It almost seemed too good to be true because unless the cameras were junk, all those 12 second clips would start adding up, but that was their business model as a young startup company that was there to prove to the world that the big names had been gouging us on not just the camera but also storage.Maybe they were going to offer paid subscriptions and this was just an appetizer and with enough people subscribing, it would offset the 12 second freebees. Maybe the cameras were actually so cheap to build that it would take years before the storage fees would add up or they were using the footage for AI research and that was their real revenue stream. Maybe all of the above. I as the customer didn't know and didn't need to know. All I knew is that these must have been really smart people who knew what they were doing so I paid and bought 2 cameras to start with and started adding to them.The first thing I noticed was that the app was very clunky - not even close to the quality of Ring or Nest. The menus were all over the place and events only included the 12 second clips and not what was on the SD card and for that, you would need to go to the SD card playback which had these right and left arrows which made it nearly impossible to find anything. The app was a Beta at best, but hey, the cameras were 25 bucks, the image quality was great, and there was a big community of fans.Then some time later, I got a notice that in-camera person detection would be discontinued because they apparently had a licensing issue with XNOR and somehow or another, they messed up and the feature was taken away with the update. Without person detection the cameras were not that useful but they promised to bring back a cloud version soon.Well, true to their word they did, except they said something like ""oh bummer, we didn't realize how much online resources person detection takes so we're going to have to charge for it, but we'll give you the option of not paying anything if you are want"" and went on this whole guilt trip.  I had paid for cameras with the belief that person detection was there but I decided against ""not paying"" and just didn't sign up. I wasn't this horrible person after all.Cut to a few months ago when I bought a couple of more V3s which are now $36ish but basically the same camera with a few improvements.  Ok, this makes sense, I thought: they must have crunched the numbers and found that cloud storage for life costs a little more so that's why there is a price increase. I'm down with that so I got the cameras.  Again, pretty nice image quality, and it's the same app which is a nightmare to use but hey, $36 camera, 12 second clips included...fair is fair.Cut to this week when they emailed us telling us they were going to offer free person detection!  Oh wow! I thought the guilt trip was over and they were just going to add it back...right?  No! The email was actually informing us that cloud storage was expensive and  to watch a video they with how terrible the pandemic was to them (which makes no sense since they don't make anything in the US and coding can be done from home) and how all their fundraising had failed and essentially, to cut costs, they were going to REMOVE the 12 second clips unless we OPT IN to them and again, name our price for them.So to recap, they want to take away features and make us beg for them as if we're dead-beats taking something for nothing.  It's very shady. I decided not to pay this time and get the feature that I had paid for. Of course they made it really hard to do so with extra guilt trips along the way. Hey, I didn't make this business plan. I did my part by paying and supporting your platform.So here we are. I'm not sure what the future will hold. They don't know what the future will hold. Will new cameras only have local storage, which buy the way can't be viewed if you share the cameras with family?  Will they go bankrupt? Is it all subscription fees going forward? I don't know. I do know that if I'm going to pay a fee, I'd rather go with Ring or Nest.  In 3 years prices have really dropped across the board."
3.0,"Decent camera, but NEEDS better Alexa integration","  I won't spend much time talking about the positives of this camera, there are thousands of reviews talking about them as well as professional reviews, but in a nutshell the setup process is easy, the image quality is pretty good, works flawlessly with a 32GB Samsung Evo MicroSD card, ASIN B06XWN9Q99, the base is magnetic and the included self adhesive metal disk allows it to be secured without screws on a shelf, and the power cord is a standard 6 foot USB-A Micro cable which attaches to a Micro-USB tail on the camera so you may be able to get an extension cable if you need it.Now, the negatives. First and foremost Wyze needs to work with Amazon to enable better Alexa integration, as it stands all Alexa can do is let you see a live view and announce person detection, it cannot turn the camera on or off. The required Wyze app can, but it would be incredibly helpful to be able to tie in the camera to Alexa's routines for people like me who do not need it recording 24/7, stopping when I say ""I'm home"" and starting when I say ""I'm leaving"", as these already can trigger Alexa Guard and other security measures, and of course ""Goodnight"" so it will properly surveil while you are asleep. Maybe this will be enabled in the near future, but right now the only workaround for voice commands is to attach it to a smart outlet, like the Kasa Smart Plug, ASIN B091FXLMS8.Second is that the sound quality is pretty muffled. For water resistance there are no open holes for the mic and speaker, so sounds are muffled and garbled. It's easy enough to understand if you're in front of it, but across the room both parties need to raise their voices in order to be heard. Also, and this may be a bug in the current firmware, but there is a terrible echo like it is picking up and repeating any sound made from it.Third is the frame rate limit for recordings, which is 20fps during the day and 15fps at night. I suspect this is also due to the ""official"" limit of 32gb MicroSD card. They could have made the limit 128gb or 256gb and allowed for 1920x1080 30FPS or even 60FPS when lighting conditions allowed for a smoother video, particularly useful if this camera is being used for surveillance when things can move quickly, allowing for clearer pictures, but I suspect this was both a cost cutting measure and a way for them to enable more broad MicroSD card support even though sufficiently fast MicroSD cards, like the aforementioned Samsung Evo, are quite inexpensive.Overall it's a decent camera. Image quality isn't spectacular, but it is inexpensive. The only major problem is the lack of Alexa integration for voice controls. If that's not important to you, it's a solid 4 star camera. If neither sound nor Alexa voice is important to you, then I'd say it's 4.5 stars because of the recording frame rate limits. There are better ones out there, but for the price it's difficult to beat.I'll update this review IF Alexa voice control to turn the camera on and off is added."
1.0,"Good Performance, Fair Price, Constantly Ads Using Phones Notification System","  There are plenty of reviews addressing the cost/performance of the Wyze Cam v3 and other Wyze products - generally they are solid performers at a fair price.  Wyze cameras can be used in a cost effective security system; detected motion generates a cell phone notification.Unfortunately, Wyze have discovered they can also use phone notifications to spam customers with ads for Wyze products.  Your choice; motion detection notifications + spam, or none of the above and no security. Perhaps next they'll offer a ""no-ad notifications"" upgrade for a small monthly fee.Customers can block phone calls and spam text messages,  but apparently not the improper use of phone notifications.  Consider this carefully before investing in the Wyze universe."
3.0,Very disappointed,"  I believe the V3 is a better camera than the V2.  But am disappointed us early customers can't get ""person detection"" without a separate cost structure.I have two V1 and three V2 Wyze cams from early on, around my house and property.  And Wyze gave us early customers a special deal for ""person detection"".  That does not apply to the V3.  Means planned obsolescence so they can abandon their early customers, and leave us behind."
1.0,Garbage camera if you can't pair it,"  got this camera for an outdoor application after having great success with the v2 and outdoor cameras, tried for 30 minutes to pair, unsuccessfully.sent it back, got a replacement, was able to pair the camera, upgraded firmware, and when installing the camera bumped the setup button, then was unable to re-pair the camera despite 20 additional minutes of trying including taking a picture of the qr code on another device and showing that to the camera.Skip the v3 and stick with the v2 camera and buy a weatherproof case or use the outdoor camera if you need outdoor coverage.extremely disappointed in this camera.Manufacture should provide alternate methods of pairing the device including the ability to scan the cameras qr code FROM a phone and pair in the opposite direction.Will try again if they ever come out with a v4, but if that fails too, I'll be smashing all the cameras with a sledgehammer and buying something that works."
3.0,DON'T UPDATE FIRMWARE,"  I've been buying Wyze cameras since their first camera.  I've probably bought 15 of them myself, recommended at least that many to other people.This V3 has the best picture quality, by-far, especially low-light situations.  BUT, the firmware is...bad.  DON'T update no matter how much the software begs you to do so.  I just installed one of these some 200+ miles from where I am and within a week a firmware update came down...and completely bricked the camera.  A week-old camera.  Lovely.To their credit, Wyze is shipping me a new camera and the replacement process was easy.  Of course, this will now mean a 3rd trip (1st - install, 2nd - pick up the damaged camera, 3rd - install the replacement) some 200+ miles each way, to get this camera going."
3.0,"V2 was horrible, V3 has a lot of problems still","  I've had the V2 cameras and had to return them because they were flat out unusable with my phone.  Livestream and playbacks were very slow, and you had to turn off the HW rendering feature.  I thought I would give the V3 cameras a shot, and although the app is much better, this is some pros and cons:Pros:1) Sony night vision sensor is awesome.  The color vision at night is great.2) Small and cheap and easy to install.3) Playback is much more improved vs V2 camera.  It's smooth now.4) Event recording has continuous recording mode.  The camera will capture events, even if poorly, but you can find the time stamp on the entire continuous video.Cons:1) Playback feature on app is also terrible.  It needs to be able to zoom into time frames, otherwise trying to move through the time slices is hard as hell and very frustrating2) Image quality is very compressed and lossy.  Compared to my old ReoLink C1 Pro camera, the bit rate at 1080P on the Wyze is about 1/10 to 1/5 the amount of the C1 Pro, and you can very much tell on the playback videos.  Wish there was a way to decrease image compression on Wyze for local storage3) Event recording is both good and bad.  A lot of times, it will capture the event and record well after the motion begins.  For example, I will see a car move out of the parking lot, but no video of someone walking to that car and getting into it.  But, it does a fair job of detecting motion and sound.  It just doesn't capture the entirety of it, and you lose out on some important videos.  However, I just found out if you record in continuous mode, it will still flag the event, and you can go back to watch the whole video.Also, I really dislike that you need a subscription to unlock things like the 5 minute gap between events.  I feel like this is probably one of my biggest gripes with this camera, and makes me want to return them for the newer Reolinks -- which IMO, is better than Wyze but more expensive too."
5.0,The Wyze v3 is a great value for a camera,"  This is my 3rd Wyze v3 camera.  I also have a few other Wyze cameras.  I like the v3 best.I recommend getting a Class 10 Micro SD memory card.  I believe the 32mb is still the max memory for Wyze.  The memory card will store about 3-4 days of HD video.The Wyze cameras are not perfect, but for $36 +memory, it's a great value.There is a mismatch of the video-to-sound that can be annoying, on all my Wyze cameras.The motion detector settings can be troublesome to set.  For example, at night, the light from car headlights will reflect off everything wet, icey, or snow covered.  Wyze does have a very flexible method to block specific areas of the view from motion detection.It's a stand alone camera system.  You don't have to buy the available monthly cloud or premium services.The app download is free.You can share your camera view with anyone else with the app.  Great for keeping an eye on the grandkids at night.The night picture is probably better than typical... I think we're having some decent moonlight.The day picture is not the greatest... very overcast.  You can see some of the sunlight peaking thru on the top of the house.The USB cord is about 5-6 feet long.  The USB power supply can plug into any 120 outlet.  I have one camera with about a 15-20' USB cord that works great.The biggest challenge for outdoor installs is to get the USB cord out to the camera.As I said.  It's a great value, and worth a few dollars to try it out."
2.0,A little good and a lot of bad,"  Update - I wanted to like this but it's too buggy.  The camera randomly records events in black and white instead of color during the daylight hours.  Despite that it's set for people motion only, it has decided that people are now vehicles and true people don't count (no changes in the settings).  It isn't recording the people.  It notifies of an event, but you have to click around for a few seconds before it finds the video and can play it (not by using the replay button listed - you have to exit the video and go out to the events to find it and see it).  Can't count on this app/camera.----------------The price is great.  The picture is very clear during the day.  The night color vision is pretty good too as long as you have just a bit of ambient light.  Alerts come across much quicker than ring.  The major issue with this camera is that it can't differentiate a moving object/person versus a change in light.  If a light goes on in a nearby room - alert.  If a car is coming up the street (don't even have to see the car) the change in light sets off an alert.  Alerts for a car light (vehicle not set for alert)  in the area every few minutes is probably going to be a deal breaker for me.  If you can control the light where this is used or just use it for checking in with no alerts, this will be a good camera.  It's a shame because other than this light issue I like it."
4.0,Super Decent Budget Cam,"  As someone who lives alone and works a lot especially during the pandemic, I need a decent security cam to monitor my house that I can view with a tap of a finger. Especially observing a rise in vehicle related crimes in my city, a truck was stolen a couple blocks away, Cadillac converters stolen, road rage, and etc. I did buy the compatible window adhesive mount, but realized that I need the cam to pointed at an angle.The good- it is less than $50 and relatively small ( roughly the size of GoPro with case). I was surprised that even without mounted flushed to the glass, the glare isn’t too bad like other cams I have bought it the past. The recording during the night with only street lights and such was pretty good.  The cam has quite a decent pic even at standard pixel (shown of me testing the cam in a dark room at night with only the tv on; shown the view outside of my house view window) even at night. Even without the subscription (one year is like $25), 12 sec is more than enough to get clips or pics of what is happening (as that what I have set of my video doorbell). You can also set your motion sensor zone, but this feature will need to be tested for the long run.The bad- despite such clarity- I can’t even make out the plates of cars parked across from my house or street sign…Even at max zoom. It also needed to be wired. And the plug adapter was faulty as I kept hearing a high pitched whizzing sound from it (which I swapped with my own usb plug). Also, if you inverted the cam, the pic/recording doesn’t rotate."
1.0,Not worth it,  Got this and a couple of storage cards because someone stabbed my tires. Night vision wasn’t good at all. It picked up some “porch” light as a vehicle when there wasn’t any. So I had so many records of nothing.  And now that the trial is over it doesn’t even pick up most motion even during the day. And now it only records a few seconds despite having a large capacity memory card in it.  If I wanted to subscribe to a particular service I would’ve gotten actual home monitoring from somewhere else. Legit waste of my time and money but I shouldn’t be surprised it was only $35z
4.0,It does work in the end,"  No matter how I tried  to connect this to my wi-fi, it just would not. All I was getting is `unable to connect` After a couple of days of frustration of continuing entering my wi-fi name and password and getting nowhere and after repeated voice telling me that it did not find the name of the wi-fi, I went into my router settings and into the wi-fi settings and changed the name. When I again tried to connect, it immediately said `connected` and I was at last able to use this cam. The quality of the scene in which it faced is top quality which displayed on my I-Pad."
1.0,Worthless Trash -- 'Ready to connect' will haunt your dreams,"  This product is complete trash.  After several hours, I got ONE of the three units to scan the stupid QR code.  That small victory was short-lived, however, as it claimed to ""time out"" almost immediately, requiring me to scan the QR code again!I gave up after another half hour of listening to that irritating voice claiming the camera was ""ready to connect""That was it ... for hours ... ""ready to connect"" ... ""ready to connect"" ... ""ready to connect""I tried with the lights on, with the lights off, at different brightness levels, heights ranging from 4"" up to 20"" -- I even built a make-shift rig to hold the phone and camera perfectly steady.  I tried scanning the QR code upside down, sideways, and a weird angle, every conceivable change I could make left me with ...""ready to connect"" ... ""ready to connect"" ... ""ready to connect""This product is trash.  I'll be returning it along with the Echo Show that Amazon claimed was ""required"" for this product."
1.0,Not WISE to buy Wyze!!,"  I purchased the Wyze Cam v3 in May 2021 (for color night vision mainly) to see if it would work with my 2.4/5GHz.  It did, picking up the 2.4.  After a month, I purchased another one.  All was well until mid August.  First, the 1st cam went offline, code error 90, for a day.  I restarted it several times but it continued to be unstable.  Contacted Wyze support, ran their test, etc. and they determined that the device was faulty; they replaced the camera.The very next week, the 2nd cam started doing the same thing.  I tried all troubleshooting help from the Wyze website, but finally had to contact them.  Again, I ran their test, reset the camera, reinstalled the cam, and it stayed on for approx. 3 minutes.  Wyze led me to believe that they would replace the camera, but has now decided that I should rename my 5 and 2.4 wi-fi frequencies, which makes no sense.  First of all, the 1st replacement cam connected to the appropriate frequency (2.4) but Wyze techs now say the second cam is ""confused"" about which frequency it should connect to -- so, one cam is confused, but the other is not!!  And, since the camera does not work with 5Ghz, why do I need to rename anything??  If the 1st camera I purchased would have required my renaming my wi-fi frequencies, I would have returned it to Amazon and certainly would not have purchased a second one.I don't think Wyze cameras are meant to last more than a few months and expect the replacement camera they sent me to not last longer than a month or two.  I was testing the camera for myself, other relatives and friends -- I will NOT be recommending this product, or any other products made by Wyze Labs, which by the way has an ""F' rating with the BBB.  I am thankful that I have another camera from another company that works flawlessly with 2.4 GHz and never goes offline.  It is a little larger than the ""UN-Wyze"" one and does not have color night vision, but it is dependable!"
1.0,Consider this before you buy,"  Consider this the camera is ok for the price, the software needs a lot of work and the constant pressure to sign up for the cloud service is Unbelievable. I installed a memory card as I do not like having another bill to pay each month, they give you a free month  of cloud service then when they cut you off they also change your ability to record over 12 seconds, and as if that’s not bad enough the re trigger time jumps to 5 minutes and you are constantly reminded that if you sign up you can record more. I will never buy another camera from this manufacturer as their main interest isn’t to have a good camera and software but to Make You sign up for their service."
5.0,No subscription!!,"  Love it! It's great to not need a subscription. Wyze provides up to 14 days on the cloud for events only, but if you add an SD card, you can view the whole 24hr (7days) recording through the app. I purchased a 64g sd card and you need/must format it through your phone or similar (check reddit for instructions) before adding it to the wyze for the proper format! After that, wyze re records over itself and can be viewed through the app for the whole 7days. Awesome!"
