4.0,Pretty Solid Smart Lock,"  — Installation —I had a old Baldwin deadbolt that wasn’t compatible out of the box. Perhaps August customer support could have helped me out with a different adaptor, but I just went ahead a purchased a new deadbolt instead.As a result I had to enlarge the hole in my door somewhat & adjust the strike plate. Hopefully, your deadbolt will be compatible (the August site has a list of ones that are), so you won’t need to swap out deadbolts as I did.The installation after that was easy. However, getting it calibrated took a bit of trial and error, but after almost giving up, I finally succeeded.— Look & Feel —The lock itself is a nice peace of hardware & is now small enough where it doesn’t look so ungainly.I also purchased the keypad. It seems to work fine, but is not the most elegant thing.— HomeKit —As other reviews have noted, the lock only works over Bluetooth with HomeKit and not via WiFiHowever, the August app works over WiFi, such as when you are at home on your WiFi network or away and on a cellular network (or any internet connection). Go figure!?Hopefully, this is a bug that August will sort out as it doesn’t make any sense.— Overall —4 stars due to the calibration hassle & HomeKit weirdness.Otherwise a solid piece of hardware that lets you go key free with the flexibility to assign multiple users to the lock including guests.Edit 2020-06-12: I edited the HomeKit portion to be more clear on the WiFi limitations."
1.0,Decent lock but terrible customer service,"  The lock seems okay so far, though apparently the way to get the instructions for installing is to first install the app and start walking through.  Also it took several tries to get it connected to wifi, which I had seen other reviews mention.  Once it connected it seems fine although it occasionally drops and reconnects.The problem I had is during installation it said to install the door sense sensor but it isn't in the box.  I emailed customer service asking if it was supposed to be included with the 4th gen lock and they said yes, it should come with the sensor but not to worry because I can buy one on their website ($25).  I replied asking if buying a sensor or returning the entire lock were my only options.  They confirmed that yes, those are the only options.  Apparently they can't throw a sensor in an envelope and mail it to me.I guess my advice is to make absolutely sure you have all the parts that are supposed to be in the box before you install it because if it is missing anything their customer service team will not do anything to correct the problem.  Either that or just buy a different brand that cares about providing good service."
1.0,A Total Failure - Avoid,"  The reason I rated the lock low is it is plagued with problems, firstly it doesn’t have enough torque. I live in Austin and we have weather-seal around door frames. This increases pressure on the deadbolt and makes it “stiffer” this device does NOT like that! I had to calibrate the deadbolt to only partially engage as it didn’t have enough torque to drive the deadbolt home and settle. Instead the lock entered an “uncertain” state where it would constantly jog the motor (running the batteries down) as it attempted to drive the deadbolt home. NOT GOOD!I don’t know if the app is behind in updates with iOS 14 and all but using voice commands with Siri and Apple Home is SUPER flaky. 20% success rate on 100% recognized commands.Siri will recognize the command 100% correctly, it’s when it goes to interact with the lock / Apple home you get about a 20% lock / unlock rate, also it’s super slow task 10 - 20 seconds to lock / unlock!I’ve had loads of “sorry I wasn’t able to lock the front door, for more details check the home app” and “I’m not sure if your door is locked, check back again” Siri messages and frankly when locking a property who wants that? The Apple Watch app is just as bad, it’s a 20% chance it will do what you want it to when you tap.Setup when integrating the device with Apple Home was super problematic and not easy to resolve! Took several resets etc.I’ve had the lock for almost 10 days now and it spectacularly fails at its core competency “being a lock that’s smart”. God help you if you were trying to get into the house in an emergency using the app, watch, siri etc. The lock is located 8 feet from the Google fiber router so connection and speed are not the issue. It’s purely down to poor software that the developer isn’t keeping updated and get more and more moldy as Apple releases OS updates.I’m going to be seeking a refund from Amazon and returning the lock. Not good enough August! Not even close!"
1.0,1 Month Battery Life Make this Lock Impractical.,"  It installed easily physically and for local Bluetooth control, but battery life is terrible..The instructions were in the app that must be loaded and had videos for each step making it very easy.  Most importantly, the device operated the deadbolt easily.  Read on for our impressions after using the August Smart Lock.  --  TERRIBLE BATTERY LIFE.  With the provided 2 batteries I got 1 month of use before battery warnings started to appear.  And this is on a side garage door that is infrequently used, maybe twice a week and then only manually actuated.  Update:  After replacing the battery the 2nd set of new batteries also only got about 1 month.  So the extremely short battery life makes this lock impractical.  Very expensive to replace 2 special batteries every month.  -- DIFFICULT NETWORK INSTALL.  Network install was DIFFICULT.  I could not get it to install on my network with my Galaxy s7 smart phone.  Following every trouble shooting step they suggest I could never get it to work.  At this point I called and spoke with support and interestingly, from their end,  they could see the lock installed on the network but my phone just kept showing an failure to install.  The tech then suggested a different phone and we then tried a Galaxy S9 and the lock installed first time on the network.  And once it was installed i could invite the other phone, the S7 and now it also was able to operate the lock.  --  EXCELLENT TECH SUPPORT  The support was excellent.  Probably the best support Ive had in a long long time.  I called the support number and spoke with a person, very quickly I might add,  who was very helpful and knowledgeable and spent all the time I needed to install the lock which was probably a good 45 minutes having gone through multiple cycles of reset, calibration, network fail until finally he suggested a different phone which worked.Conclusion.  Replacing the batteries every month!  Forget it!.  I'm sorry, sounds like a good company but the short batter life means this his is the first and last August Smart Lock I'll ever use."
4.0,"Works as Advertised, but...","  Update 1/3/2022 - This lock is not compatible with ES Impact Doors.  Recently replaced old door with ES-MX3000 door.  The new door accommodates a Schlage deadbolt lock, but the door needs to be securely closed for the deadbolt to fully engage.  This August lock will not engage the deadbolt under normal conditions.I had a Schlage electronic combo lock on my door and it was not listed as compatible with this device, but as it turned out, it is.  I did have to remove the inside lever (and battery, electronics, etc.) and replace it with this August smart lock, which rendered the combo lock useless, but still allowed me to use the existing keys when needed.  Of course this device does provide the same deadbolt security (it uses the existing mechanism), while adding Wi-Fi and BT control via apps.  I programmed it to auto-unlock when I get close to my door.  You can program it to auto-lock also, but if you go out without your phone and/or key, you could find yourself locked-out.  So, when I leave, I got into the habit of using my phone to lock my door.  It is very cool as I get close to my door, the app sends a notification welcoming me home and letting me know that my door in being auto-unlocked.The install process took all of about 10 minutes.  The instructions were quite adequate - just about removing 2 screws and reinstalling them with the smart lock's mounting bracket.The only issue I had was with the Wi-Fi connection.  I did have to get a range extender and position it close enough to the door to maintain a persistent connection to my network.  My advice is to buy the highest speed and greatest range extender you can find.  They are not all the same, and they need to be placed where they get good signal from both your router and the devices that connect through it.  It took some trial and error to find the sweet spot, but I do now have a stable connection.  Tech Support was of no use.8/24/20 - Update:  While the device works pretty much as advertised, there is a bug with sustaining a Wi-Fi connection.  I reported this to tech support and emailed them log files several times.  They said that they created a bug report.  Several times during a 24 hour period, I get notifications that the connection was lost, followed immediately by another notification that the connection was recaptured.  They claim that -60dB signal is required.  The app reports that the signal strength is -41dB - much better than the minimum - and this is with 13 feet between the door and the range extender (see the picture).  It also seems to go to sleep, as when I check the lock status, sometimes it says ""Unknown"", eventually becomes known and when I check the signal strength it is typically -41.  I have a Ring door bell cameral on the otherside of the door that does not have this problem, using the same range extender.9/12/20 - Amazon customer support sent me another August smart lock, but I sent it back as after moving my range extender within 10 feet of the door (see pix) the Wi-Fi connection stablized and stopped sending disconnect notifications.  I am updating now as fresh batteries seemed to die after less than 3 weeks (8/26 to 9/12).  All BT and Wi-Fi connection was lost.  I replaced the batteries and BT became active, but no Wi-Fi.  I tried to reconnect to the network using the app. - NG.  I finally did a factory reset and started a new install.  That worked.  This tells me that you need to pay attention to the status of the batteries as the device/app does not warn you.  Also, when the batteries die, the device forgets who it is and needs to be reinstalled after you replace the batteries."
3.0,Great Smart Deadbolt; Easy to Install: First Unit Broke,"  EDITED: After a week, the August Wifi Smart Lock failed to work. Attempted to recalibrate it and received repeated error messages [Sorry. Something Went Wrong]. Spent an hour with a helpful rep from August who diagnosed it as a broken motor after demonstrating the issue via a Skype tech support call. Unit is being returned. Dropped the review from 5 stars to 3 because of the product failure, but also I still think if it functions correctly, this would represent the best combo of a smart lock that still lets you use your standard keyed deadbolt.Added the latest August Smart Lock to a new Kwikset front door handle & deadbolt. Results pictured.- Product installation is very easy; directions available in the August app that you'll download & use to control the lock. [I use an Android (Google Pixel) smartphone.)- The small white device on the door frame is used to detect the lock's position and communicate it through the app. So, for instance, if the door is ajar, you'll know. App also tracks all opening/closing activity.- The black cover behind the lock is only needed if the hole bored out for your deadbolt is large and needs covering. It doesn't hinder or impede installation at all.- 'Satin nickel' doesn't match the same finish designation on the Kwikset doorknob, but I'm not really a stickler for exact match- I chose this over the Yale/Google Nest smart deadbolt because with the August you only change the interior hardware, and can still use the traditional exterior entry key that comes with the deadbolt.Highly recommended product."
4.0,Awesome lock for HomeKit.....IF you know all the details....,"  I normally don't write a review as fast as this (I got my lock and installed it yesterday), but there are some important facts that I didn't realize when I bought it.  This is for all my HomeKit people, I am a 100% pure Siri operated house.  My requirement is that everything I buy and install must be HomeKit compatible.  I don't want to deal with multiple electronic personalities in my home, it is already crazy enough as it is.  I came across this lock initially because Amazon listed the older gen version on sale for under $100 (Used-Like New).  I started researching to see the differences between that one and this one.  The old one required a plug-in bridge in order for the lock to gain WiFi Access, whereas this one has WiFi built in.  And this one is sleeker, newer, better, etc..... I am one of those who operates on the policy that if it costs more, its better, so I buy it (no judgement please).Anyway, here is the little nugget that is hidden away in the August help articles.  Well, maybe it isn't that hidden, but I certainly didn't realize it.  If you are using HomeKit, then the lock MUST be within BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) range of your home hub.  For me, I use Apple TV 4K as my hub.  Which is in my living room.  Which is about 80' or so away from the detached garage where I installed this lock.  But fret not, there is a very simple work-around (which I'll get to in a minute).Install of the lock, mechanically at least, was super easy.  Connecting to WiFi and getting the app set up was a bit of a pain.  Now, to be fair, I use a Netgear Orbi mesh system, and my satellites were in need of an update, so its possible that played a role.  But I had to reset the lock twice before I could get the thing reliably online.  First few attempts, wouldn't connect.  Then, it connected, but wouldn't give me a signal.  Finally, I got it all squared away and the lock was good to go.  Or so I thought.  Then came the HomeKit part.  So, you have to setup HomeKit through the August App.  But, at the time, I wasn't tracking the BLE range for it to work.  So I kept having problems.  I ended up deleting the lock from my home through the Home app.  But, when I did, even though it was gone, the lock was still registered, so I couldn't re-add it.  I did some internet searching, found a help article that had the answer.  I actually had to remove the lock portion (not hard, two little black clips that open out), then hold a red button on the back of the unit for 7 seconds to reset the lock.  After that, I was able to get it back into Apple Home.  But I still  spent the next 30 minutes trying to figure out the ""No Response"" problem in Home.  Which led me to the inter-webs, which led me to the help articles, which eventually led to the knowledge that, despite the fact that it is a WiFi enabled app.....it uses BLE for HomeKit.  Seems dumb, but is what it is.Now the workaround, when you have a device setup as a hub for Home (iPad, TV, Homepod), it acts as a BLE hub as well (if you are home smart-er than me, don't judge my terminology, I'm new here and learning as a go).  Anyways, when you add hub devices, they automatically act as BLE extenders.  So, for example, in my home, I've got an Apple TV in the living room, which is my main hub.  I then have a few HomePod Minis through the house for Siri control and ease of access.  The HomePod Minis passively act as BLE range extenders (Apple never ceases to amaze).  The WiFi lock on the shop no-worky, but when I move one of the HomePod Minis out to the detached garage, it acts as the BLE extender, and bam, lock works.All in all, I love that this lock only replaces the back thumb plate, that it is very discreet and no indication of a smart lock from the outdoors.  It is sleek looking, makes cool robot noises, and very smooth in operation.  Armed with the knowledge I have now about HomeKit operation, I can comfortably move forward with swapping the rest of the locks on my property.  But, to be fair, this is a day one review.  I may be back after a month of operations with some more accurate feedback.  But hopefully, you the reader can be saved the time and effort it took for me to get to this point, and just skip straight to the ""yay, it works!"" part."
1.0,Doesn't work for users classified as 'Guest',"  While this device works perfectly for any user classified as an 'Owner' (who, by definition, have complete  access to all the features, including remote control from anywhere on the planet), for users classified as 'Guest' (only able to lock and unlock from on site) it doesn't work at all.A trouble ticket opened with August resulted in the following response: ""Thank you for reaching out to us. We are truly sorry for the inconvenience this has caused you.There is a known issue that causes Guest access level users to have trouble connecting to lock. Our team is aware of the situation and they are working on it.""How in the world did this thing ever get released to the market with such a severe problem? Until the issue is resolved, the lock is of no use, as it was installed on a restaurant's main entrance for use by several non-managerial staff members. I can't allow just anyone to be able to unlock the door from anywhere, at will."
5.0,No complaints from me,"  I rarely leave reviews but I love this smart lock and seeing the bad reviews I felt like I had to even things out a little. I think my good experience can be explained by looking at what most negative reviews are complaining about: the auto (un)lock feature (which I don't use) and problems with the wifi (which I don't experience as my setup is pretty beefy).Hardware installation was an absolute breeze, it really isn't any more complicated than installing a regular deadbolt. If you already have a deadbolt then all you need is a screwdriver: no need for new screws or new holes as you're simply re-using the ones from your existing deadbolt.The wifi setup is where I expected things to go wrong based on the reviews, but that was a breeze as well. I'm running multiple access points (Ubiquiti AP AC PRO) but none of them are on the same floor as the smart lock, so it connects to the one on the floor immediately above it. The Unifi dashboard shows the lock as having -72dBm signal, so not great, but it has worked flawlessly nonetheless. Looking at the client history I do see that it loses the connection every few days but it reconnects immediately (see attached screenshot). I run a combined 2.4Ghz / 5Ghz network using the same SSID and the lock connected to the 2.4Ghz network automatically without me having to disable the 5Ghz.As far as the auto (un)lock feature, I haven't been using it so I can't comment on it, but that's where a lot of folks seem to be having issues. I bought the lock mostly in case I forget my keys and get locked out, or for those times I'm laying in bed and suddenly wonder if I locked the front door, and it's worked amazingly well for those use cases."
3.0,*Updated* Unreliable Connection,"  I'll leave my original review below, but since purchasing and setting up my lock seven months ago, the connection issue has been mostly resolved.  I had to remove and add the lock several times as well as uninstalling and reinstalling the Android app before it was finally recognized and kept the connection.  I've since upgraded from one start to three.  The reason for the three star rating is because although the connection issue was fixed, the battery drains way too often.  I found myself having to replace the battery about once every 5 weeks or so.  I've contacted support thinking maybe it was a false reading or perhaps I got a bad device, but customer support was a lacking.  It'd take a few days for an answer and the answers were basically regurgitations of the online FAQs.  The only other option was sending it back and that meant removing it from the door and either putting the old deadbolt back or having a gaping hole until a new unit arrived.  I'm satisfied enough for the most part, but the poor battery makes this a hard to repeat purchase.ORIGINAL REVIEW:  I've had my eye on the August smart lock for a while.  I liked the idea of using my existing deadbolt and bluetooth integration.  I already have a Yale Nest deadbolt on my other door and while I like it, you can't add additional users without giving them access to your other Nest products.  I installed the August lock on my front door (the Nest is on my side door) so that I could give temporary access to friends.  Installation was easy enough; I followed the directions step by step in the app and had no issues.  It took a couple of tries in the app to get it connected to my network, but eventually I was up and running.  The app seems to be pretty bare bones, but easy enough to navigate.  I linked it to my Google Assistant and was pleasantly surprised that I could lock as well as unlock my door by voice (the Nest lock will only lock).  I tested the locking feature out several times--by voice, app, and manually--to make sure it worked and it did.  At least, it did while I was in my home.  The minute I stepped out to run an errand and attempted to lock the door through the app while still standing in my walkway, it could not connect to my lock.  I stood there for far too long trying to get it to connect before I just walked back to the door and locked it with my key.  After leaving my house, I tried again to connect to it through the app, but it would not work at all.  After returning home and trying several more times, I decided to just factory reset my lock and try the process over again.  Once again, it worked and I was able to lock and unlock through the app.  I also set up the smart lock and unlock features in the hopes that it would just do that automatically when I leave and return so that I didn't have to fidget with the app.  The next day when I left home, I attempted to access the lock through the app to make sure it was locked, and once again, it refuses to connect.  The 'connecting' screen will either hang indefinitely or tell me it cannot connect and suggest I purchase the bridge.  What use is this smart lock when I can't check the status once I leave the house?  As it stands now, this lock is pretty much useless to me.  I don't need to check the status in the app while I'm home because I'm home.  I can't lock it once I leave the house even when I'm literally standing five feet from it and cannot check the lock through the app once I'm away.  I refuse to try purchasing the bridge because this lock supposedly does not need it.  I'd like to give it higher than one star simply because it was easy to install and looks and feels nicely built, but the features and app are useless."
1.0,Do not buy,"  As others have stated this lock has a ton of issues connecting via wifi and Bluetooth. When I first got the lock wifi would constantly disconnect as I have a Google Nest Wifi. Since I read that this was an issue for others since you cannot separate the 5 GHZ and 2.4 GHZ channels I bought a dedicated router to handle the 2.4 GHZ connections. This sadly did not resolve the issue and when I contacted support they were less than helpful.I had the same experience as many others with their support. I contacted them and they said to send the logs and then wait for a firmware update or if it was a hardware issue they would reach out. Being that a number of people have submitted tickets months ago and we are still seeing this issue is telling me they don't have any idea on how to fix it, or they just don't have the bandwidth to fix it.I wanted to like the lock as It does have a number of cool features, but if I can't even connect to it to use those features it's useless in my book. Maybe in the future I will purchase another one once they have their products tested better."
1.0,Awful experience,"  I’m not sure what happened with August. I had a first generation lock that used to be great. It worked reliably, remotely, and fantastically with multiple users. It got worse and worse over time. First, the remote capabilities got less reliable and then stopped working entirely. Then at some point my family was saying they couldn’t operate the lock anymore - always just saying “setup needed” in Apple Home app (HomeKit) and the August app itself not being much better. They were all set up as owners.So I figured it was time to upgrade maybe? Hoping this new generation would be smaller and bring back the reliability I once knew. So I ordered it, installed it, and was sorely disappointed that every issue I had with the first generation plagued the new one as well.August support articles were no help. Half of them wouldn’t even come up on their website.So I returned it and went with another HomeKit-compatible lock by a different manufacturer. Turns out the issues I had with August were unique to August. This other one is super simple, works great with multiple users, and has reliable remote access. Also responds WAY faster.I loved you, August… but you changed. It’s not me, it is you. Bye."
1.0,We completely wasted $250 on this POS!!!!!,"  So let me start by saying I had absolutely high high hopes for this lock based one the reviews I had read.  However from the second it arrived its been a complete nightmare!This lock has a horrible wifi signal and is constantly losing signal to the point I had to move one of my google nest routers right next to the front door!!!  It still continually loses signal even with the router less than 5 feet away and a download speed of 200mb+ I know its not my router.Update 11/14/20: As I wanted to give this time to see if the issues subsided and without question they have not!  We purchased the keypad and have never seen a device eat thru batteries like this one does.  No warning, just when you need to enter your code using the keypad the thing is DEAD!The lock continually still goes offline, and we've even purchased a Google Mesh Wifi which has done amazing things at extending our wifi, but yet the only device that still seems to lose connection is the AUGUST POS.Wish I could get my money back as this was by far the worst purchase I have ever made!!!!The application for Apple is OK at best, but clearly needs some work... overall I would RUN as far away from this lock as you can.I lost $250 on this POS and all I can do is help others steer clear of this thing."
3.0,"Initially liked it, but short battery life changed my mind","  After using a 3rd Generation August lock on my primary residence for 4 months, I decided to add an August lock to my vacation home.  I really like the smaller size of the 4th generation, so I bought it.Installation was straightforward and it worked fine.  But after only 6 weeks, I started getting alerts from the app and by email that the batteries were critically low.  That would be a problem anywhere, but especially for a second home, it doesn't work.Update:  August support explained that having a mesh network as I do (XFi router and pods) can cause the batteries to drain faster because the the mesh software is constantly testing the connections to make sure they are using the best connection.  They recommended trying a hub where the wifi connection is handled the hub which is plugged in and has plenty of power available to handle the wifi and the communication with the lock is handled via a lower power method.  I raised my rating from 1 star to 3 stars based on the tech support and proffered solution.  You have to understand how August support works.  In my experience, you never are able to directly interact with anyone.  You send an email and generally someone gets back to you within a day or so.  If you are persistent, they will work with you.I have contacted August technical support.  They said expected battery life for this model is 3-6 months.  That would still be problematic, but is still much more than I have experienced, at least with the original batteries.  They asked me questions about my home Wifi.  If they provide a solution, I will edit this post."
1.0,Completely unreliable products and company,"  Tried 4 different locks in two locations in my wither well-connected home, and the devices would never behave reliably, either on wifi or bluetooth (tried one, the other, and both active). The August app would occasionally control the locks, other times pulse and pause forever, sometimes would indicate the lock was unavailable, sometimes no status at all. Sometimes the states were reversed - lock was physically in an unlocked state, but app showed lock. HomeKit integration was far worse, often shown unlocking or locking forever, or no response.Factory reset locks several times, reset HomeKit settings from the back pushpin several times, all to no avail. Even tried a separate Wifi network dedicated only to the locks, but no change in condition (note that existing Velop 6 wifi mesh works for all other devices in the mode and yard with no issues, but nonetheless tried this). Tried three different iOS devices as well, and iOS 13 and 14, and latest version of this appTech support is vague, slow, lacks continuitiy, and after two months, completely unable to even sniff what the issue might be. Amazon has issued an extended return to me for this as they are useless.I spent 15-20 hours troubleshooting this, but without any other devices in my home having wifi or HomeKit issues, and August's own app showing severe performance issues, it can only be their HW/SW.Recommend that you avoid this at all costs. Full stop.I do have a Schlage Sense which works 100% reliably via its own app and via HomeKit as well. Also evaluating SimpleSafe Smart locks (will use HomeBridge to integrate to HomeKit if it is otherwise reliable)."
1.0,Did not work Poor quality app and packaging (Time waste),"  The lock was not able to connect with the app. There is no troubleshooting or support instructions given. The packaging and app also indicates poor quality. Packaging is hard to unpack, and app interface is very couter-intuitive. At minimum the app should have a support number if it does not work. App simply hangs and does not do anything. A poor quality product trying to act like high-tech. It just makes you waste a few hours trying to get it working. Returned."
1.0,Very short battery life,"  I have not even had this lock installed for 2 months yet and the batteries are dead. This lock takes lithium CR123 batteries so it is not like they are cheap to replace. If I had the space between the two locks I would just use my SimpliSafe lock instead of this piece of crap. As it is, I have to shell out an extra $50 to even bridge the August lock with my SimpliSafe system. I will not be doing that since I only get 1.5 months of use out of the lock already and that will likely decrease if I bridge the lock and system.Do NOT buy this lock unless you have stock in lithium CR123 batteries."
2.0,Unreliable Software,"  The hardware and installation are really great. Just a well designed product. However, that’s where the delight ended and the frustration started. Things seem to work fairly well over a bluetooth connection but over wifi it is so inconsistent...my lock’s wifi connection is excellent yet sometimes the app lags for as much as 60 seconds if I am connected to wifi but not bluetooth. Worse yet, I’ve gotten ‘low battery’ notifications about 10 times in the first two weeks. After throwing out what were basically new batteries and getting low battery the next day, I tried pulling the battery out and replacing. Works again for a few days until I have to repeat. Every time I use the app widget in iOS (I hoped this would be handier than searching for the app) the lock gets confused, won’t lock/unlock, and needs to be completely recalibrated before it will work. I can’t count on the thing to work so I can’t leave my keys behind or trust that my Alexa routine will lock the door without checking on it as I go to bed...what’s the point. Hopefully they figure this stuff out because there is a lot of potential here. At $250, don’t buy this thing until it gets 5 star reviews."
5.0,Outstanding lock that's easy to use and looks great!,"  While this is not my first smart device, it is my first smart lock.Initial impressions are 1000% positive!  It looks great and the manual operation is super easy with the heavy duty and easy-to-turn dial  Smart features are well thought out and easy to understand and operate.  Lock looks solid and feels very sturdy in your hand as you manually lock.  Great feature.Installation: Took no more than 5 minutes to install the Hardware.  Basic instructions were in the package with more detailed instructions on-line.  Very complete.  Downloaded the August app  and the setup was quick and easy.  Some reviewers complained about the Calibration process.  I had no issues at all.  I held my phone next to the unit (as the instructions point out) and the calibration process completed with one cycle.  The iPhone app then guided me through the WiFi connectivity.  The lock found my 2.4 Ghz WiFi which is at the absolute opposite end of my house and connected immediately.Operation:  All features on the lock work as advertised.  The auto-unlock feature works flawlessly as I pulled my car into the garage and entered my WiFi range.  My wife absolutely loves that as she is tired of fumbling for keys with hands full.  Door sense lets you know if the door is ajar and the auto-lock worked to perfection locking the door after a minute.  Audible tones alert you to locking and unlocking which is very helpful.Bottom line:  I highly recommend this lock for anyone looking to upgrade an older lock and move to a smart-lock experience.  At $249 you simply can't go wrong."
5.0,Tried Kwikset & Schlage SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO.  Get August.,"  In the past couple of years, I have tried both the Schlage and Kwikset smart locks.  While they do work, the installation and user interface trail August by years!  But most importantly, the connectivity, the August is quick to respond.  Integrates well with HomeKit.If you have any of the Schlage or Kwikset, it's time to upgrade.  If you are deciding which one to get, get the August.- Installation took less than 5 minutes.  Included drilling a small hole for the DoorSense flush mount.  (user manual said 5/8"" drill bit, but I had to use a bit bigger).- Setup took another 5 minutes (including updating firmware)- Responsive.  While others may take 5-10 seconds to react,  the August lock took between 1-3 seconds."
2.0,"I almost loved it, but the software isn’t up to the task","  After owning three Schlage z-wave locks in my last home, this lock, and the August version of the Yale lock are a big disappointment. There is no integration with Z-wave, and IFTT can read ‘history’ but not the current lock state and it can’t lock the door. The iPhone software is sorely lacking in basic features. For the door to the garage, we are in and out throughout the day, and my wife doesn’t always carry her phone, but the only option for auto lock is 10 seconds to 30 minutes. On my old system, the deadbolts locked at 10pm, or texted me if they were ajar. I still have to manually check these locks each night to make sure we are secure.The other big problem is WiFi connectivity drops and reconnects constantly throughout the day, even though I have three orbi rbr750’s and have super strong signal at the locks location. The Yale august lock is even worse with Bluetooth that is less than 4’ from the august connect, but has a super weak signal and eats batteries once a month."
1.0,August 4th Generation Lock is NOT Market Ready and DOES NOT WORK as Advertised,"  Installation- Easy Installation into Existing Deadbolt Location. It would have helped if there were better instructions; however, intuitive enough to figure out... just took longer to install.-Calibrating the lock was not super easy and took some trial and error; however, finally figured it out after 30+ minutesAPPEARANCEThe lock has a pretty clean look, it is reasonably sized.  If offered in Brushed Nickel would have matched our existing hardware so we had to settle for black.FUNCTION- We like that it works off Bluetooth / Wifi and doesn't require a Bridge.- From here the function goes South... we purchased the Lock to allow ""Guests"" to access one of properties on a daily basis without use of a Key... which also allows us to track who comes and go.  However, you cannot allow ""Guest Access"" at this time.  We contacted Support and they notified us that this is a ""Known Bug"".  Their advice was to give everyone ""Owner Access"" which is insane, because Owners can add and delete Guests, change Settings, see who Accesses and When...- From time to time, lock has hard time connecting or takes time...  so you have to be patient.OVERVIEWThe Lock does not function as advertised... if a Property Owner needs access works fine... however, if your goal for the lock is to allow Guests, Cleaners, Contractors, etc, into the Property with keyless entry and keep track of them the lock is useless.  it is a $250 Deadbolt."
1.0,Doesn’t stay connected,  Try to imagine coming home to a front door lock that randomly takes itself offline.Every. Single. Day.By default August has notification of the lock going offline disabled. There is a reason for this. Enable it it and you’ll see. These locks go offline and reconnect a dozen or more times.Every. Single. Day.Before you conclude it must be my WiFi. Let me assure you it is not. Every other device is online continuously. Even positioning a dedicated Google Nest Router next to the front door didn’t change a thing. The lock still randomly disconnects and reconnects continuously.Every. Single. Day.Foolishly bought two of these disasters and ended up tossing them. Replaced it with a WiFi lock from a proper lock manufacturer and guess what? It stays connected.Every. Single. Day.
5.0,"Comparison of August, Schlage, and Lockey","  This is my third ""smart"" deadbolt lock. With each purchase I've relied on expert reviews, which have been valuable, but technical reviews can't capture the experience of actually living with a lock, which is what I'll try to capture here. Here are the pros and cons after living with several different locks.Schlage Connect BE469. My first experience with the Schlage smart lock was good. It was relatively easy to install, and it had a removable ring, making it one of the few smart locks that fit in smaller bore holes (which are surprisingly common in any house old enough to vote). The Schlage has a keypad, so you can get in even if you don't have your keys or your phone. It also has a traditional key, which is useful if the batteries die, although you'll have to have a locksmith re-key it if you want the key to match others (e.g., your back door). The biggest disadvantage of the Schlage lock is that it requires a hub for remote control, like letting a contractor into the house while you're at work. The first Schlage BE469 I installed worked fine with my Wink Hub 2, but then Wink had financial troubles and started charging a monthly fee. So I switched to a Samsung SmartThings Hub. Weird thing is that the hub worked fine to control one Schlage, but said the other Schlage (which was bought two weeks later on Amazon) was too old a version and wouldn't allow advanced features like remote control. I spent months trying to solve the problem (upgrading firmware of both lock and hub, uninstalling and reinstalling, deleting and reinstalling the app, etc.), but nothing ever worked. I finally removed the second Schlage and replaced it with this August lock.So ... on to the August lock. First of all, installation was a breeze, since the lock using the exiting outside keyed portion and deadbolt, replacing only the inside thumb latch. Easy. Second, the app is very well designed, including the guided tutorial for both physical installation and smart setup. After setup, the app is super intuitive, and the graphics that indicate door status are smart. The log file is complete, accurate, and easy to read. Third, since August replaces only the lever, you can keep your existing key as backup. Fourth, the new August lock is a lot smaller than earlier versions. Downsides: No external keypad, so you have to have either your key or your phone for access. This is a bummer, since I often take neither for walks. Also, rated battery life is shorter than for other locks -- this is the price of direct WiFi. The lock comes only in silvery grey -- I wish there were a brass option to match my other existing door hardware. The biggest factor for me, and why I really like this lock, is that the remote feature works reliably. That's a huge deal for me, since the primary reason I got the lock is so that I can let in contractors when I'm not home. I can open the lock then relock it when they leave, without giving them a keypad code. The remote locking works reliably even though my deadbolt isn't perfectly aligned (we normally have to push the door shut before throwing the deadbolt, but the August lock gives it a second then third effort and always manages to get the bolt in place, even without holding the door shut).Last, but not least, I also have old-fashioned mechanical keyless locks on other doors. It has push button buttons and you set the combination mechanically inside the lock before installing. No batteries. The brand I have is a Lockey. The downsides are that you can't open the lock remotely with an app, and if you have to give out the combination, then the person you gave it to will have access unless you physically remove the lock and change the combination. The upside is that you don't have to carry a key or a phone. Another upside is that this type of lock is incredibly hassle and maintenance free -- I installed Lockey mechanical locks on an exterior garage door and two basement doors 25 years ago, and they're all still working great. If you don't need to lock and unlock your door remotely, this old mechanical technology is worth considering.That's it. I hope this real-life experience of living with different generations, technologies, and brands of smart locks over the past quarter century is of some use to you in deciding which lock will best serve your needs."
4.0,Investment in Security,"  This is a review of the “August Wi-Fi, (4th Generation) Smart Lock – Fits Your Existing Deadbolt in Minutes, Matte Black” purchased for $235.Summary: I would buy this again and again (and likely will for other doors). I did my homework for 18 months and this is my investment. I state investment intentionally as cost for your home’s possessions should not be a price-point decision. This was approximately $50 more than some other locks and that is okay. The company is going to focus on home security, has many new features and versions being released (more than other brands per my research) andPros:- Family win. Everyone in the family now can use the front door without keys. Every kid has a phone…and now a digital key.- Good App. Works as expected and quickly without delays.- Simple install. Intuitive setup (if you don’t overthink or try to outsmart the instructions – follow the App Setup…it is awesome step-by-step)- Works with SmartThings. I have rules to monitor the doors for lock status, etc. Nice to have one place everything is integrated to.- Features I love are 1) Lock within 10 seconds of door closed, 2) Do not auto unlock with phones within proximity (safety issue), 3) audible sound when lock is closed (can hear inside and outside to know the door locked).- Customer Support (email) responsiveness. I have an issue and customer service responds up to twice a day with dialog, next steps, etc. WOW.Cons:- Apple Watch app not working. (Apple Watch Series 1, iPhone 11). Customer service has worked to support with extensive steps, but without resolution. This is now a bug fix for the developers.- Most desired feature for simplicity of use was the Apple Watch. Now I use the iPhone.- The App requires one unnecessary step to select the lock you want to use….even if you only have one lock! So, each time I open the App I have to first select the lock and then unlock. Wouldn’t it be great if this was intelligent enough to know that if you have ONE lock installed, you don’t need the extra step. Open App, Unlock.Recommendation: Do NOT setup with Amazon Alexa without a pass code. All it would take is a burglar to yell into your house “Alexa, open the front door” and they are in. : )  You laugh, but c’mon man, someone will do it…"
2.0,Would not connect to wifi,"  I will preface my review by saying I already own another August Smart Lock, 3rd generation, which works great.  We added the 4th generation lock on another door.  The installation was easy, but I was not able to get the lock to stay on wifi for more than one lock/unlock cycle.  It would continually disconnect, and was listed as not available in the August app.  It is possible I got a faulty lock, as I can't imagine this working so poorly and it not having an issue.  I decided to send it back and not risk another."
1.0,Critical Flaws - Doesn't lock when it says it is.,"  I have had this lock for about a month now. I saw that the reviews were 4.5 stars so I assumed that it was a good product.  The setup process was a bit clunky.  The worst part about this though is sometimes when I open the app the door says its locked when it isn't!  This is a huge security issue.  I was recently out of town and didn't know if my front door was unlocked for several days or not.  What's the point of having a lock if the app is giving you the wrong state of open or shut.  I would say this is a critical flaw and these products should be recalled.  Not sure why they haven't already.  I was alarmed after downloading the app and the reviews for that were much worst than what is on Amazon.  I paired it with my Alexa also, and just tested it and said ""Alexa, lock front door""  as I was standing next to the door, alexa came back and said ""Front door is locked""  It was not.  This is a fatal flaw that need to be fixed or the company need to issue a recall."
1.0,I would give this a -1 if I could,"  Ok, at first it worked OK but then started eating batteries - as in they lasted less than 1 week.I contacted August and they said that since I have a mesh router it needs a bridge (this was not stated anywhere).So they sent me a bridge. I tried installing the bridge but it said it's not compatible with any of my devices. So August said to uninstall everything and reinstall.Ok, so after several attempts the lock and bridge were installed (and I do mean several attempts of getting random errors and the lock not calibrating or door sense not working).Ok, so then I try to reinstall my keypad and that does not work at all. So after an hour of trying over and over again in the awful app (seriously  on some pages the blue button is continue on others it's the gray and the blue is to stop. Somethings it says try again other times it makes you quit and begin the entire process over and over again).The best I could get is to get the app to recognize the keypad but it does not work and it keeps blinking like it's in set up mode. I've tried the reset code and removing batteries numerous times.So I took off the bridge and started all over again but no matter what the keypad, which worked perfect ly before, will not work at all. Now the entire door is useless and my kids and wife just had a code to come and go. This is why I got the smart lock because they would forget keys, etc. but they could use the keypad to come and go with the August. Now that doesn't work the entire thing is a waste and now, when I am trying to go to work (I would have guess the 2 hours I allotted for this was overkill but I guess not) I am instead stuck because if I go my family has no way to enter the house.Forget You August, this is unacceptable and complete garbage. This is a deadbolt, a safety feature, you should damned well make sure it works and is robust but I guess not."
1.0,Terrible Customer Service,"  We purchased TWO smart locks over 6 months ago and spend at least 2-3 hours PER WEEK on hold trying to get in touch with your service folks because we continue to have major issues and unable to use our locks. They even failed completely while we were on an overseas trip and we had to make hours worth of international calls to try and get in touch with someone. Now, it appears you've shut off your phones with a message saying that you are no longer taking service calls. Absolutely want our money back."
1.0,Could not install because of the app,"  I tried for hours to update the firmware of this lock as demanded by the app, and it failed every time because of some software bug. I also couldn't connect it to WiFi because of some different software bug. I spent 90 minutes on the phone with a customer support representative who tried many times to get the lock to update and connect, but she could not. I was told that there are ""issues"" with certain Samsung devices including my Galaxy S9+ (a very common device). Why was this not mentioned anywhere!? August could have avoided wasting several hours of my life if they had just said somewhere in the marketing material that this is an iPhone-only product or whatever.I am sending the lock back for a refund and I will not be making any future purchases of August products."
4.0,A few improvements could make it much better,  Overall loved the ease of installation. The first lock took me 10min but the second only 3min.Love the product but there are a few improvements that might make it a better product.1) App requires too many steps to open/close the lock. Don't see the reason to click on Home & then select 1 of many locks and then press the button to open/close. Most folks have just 1 home so all these steps could be skipped.2) Battery life could be improved by allowing to only use one of Wifi/Bluetooth if not needed3) Notifications are sent unnecessarily even when the lock is manually locked4) Does not work consistently with Apple's Homekit. Siri often fails to unlock5) Hard to install the flush mount magnet. If they just provide a flat magnet we can use some krazy glue instead of drilling holes
5.0,"Great lock, confused by negative reviews..",
1.0,Buy something else,"  Do yourself a favor and move on until August can work out the bugs. I installed my lock a few weeks ago, and it was a breeze! The app started up fine and connected without issue. But that was the last time it functioned as desired.The lock would lose connectivity always, so I bought a wifi extender and installed it 5 feet from the lock and connected the lock to it via the app. Still would drop the connection. I replaced the batteries, the same issue.  I went to the app, and now it won't even register my bluetooth from 1 foot away.I am a first time August user. This lock has been nothing but a headache, and I would not recommend August or it's smart locks."
5.0,works with Apple Watch without iPhone,"  I was hesitating to buy this, not being certain if it would work with apple watch when I don't have my phone with me. Support gave me an answer that didn't make any sense. I took a chance and bought it. It works fine. It is only the auto unlock feature that doesn't work without the phone. I can unlock the door manually using the watch app without my phone. Sometimes there is a lag of about 15 seconds, not sure why when I am right next to the lock.I agree with the other reviewers: it is easy to install. If it would be nice if the installation instructions were not too scripted on the phone. I didn't finish installing the door sense since I didn't have the right drill bit. Now I cannot get back to it. I need to hunt for the instructions on the web or start over from the beginning including the set up.Setting up Apple Home Kit was a challenge for two occupants at first, but that is for the quirkiness of Apple's home kit app. Five stars for August, one asteroid for Apple Home Kit."
1.0,Works great with bluetooth.  Terrible wifi and remote functionality.,"  If you're connected to the lock via bluetooth it works great.  I'm wondering if most of the positive reviews are due to this because that's how it's configured by default so unless you were trying to operate it remotely or disabled bluetooth on your phone, it would seem like it works fine.  When using just the wifi (which is what you'd need to do to operate it when you're not at home), it's terrible.  I put this thing right next to my router and it wouldn't stay connected and operate properly.  I tried various wifi settings and I have some networking knowledge, but no go.  When it does stay connected, it takes 15-30 seconds to lock or unlock.  That makes me believe that it's not just the wifi but maybe an issue with the service it connects to remotely to operate it.  Overall, using wifi is horrible and I had to return it."
2.0,eats batteries,"  Meh.  I can't believe all the great tech-press August continues to get.  I've used several Kwikset Premis locks, and thought I'd switch after the lack of support when iOS changed their bluetooth connectivity (which they did fix after several months).  I've had the 4th G lock for a year now, and it's pretty flaky.  Initial setup was ok.  Installation NBD, but as others pointed out seems to be sometimes necessary, had to reset and reinstall several times.  The deadbolt sensor needs to be right over the deadbolt, meaning it's on the trim and sticks out, looking stupid.  Feature-wise, auto unlock works ~90% of the time and is pretty reliable.  I don't at all like that guests need to also install the app and register an account, which totally limits its flexibility.My main issue is that it eats batteries.  It's done this for a year.  Tech support is useless and slow (of the ""try reinstalling"" variety).  It seems to be a universal issue.  It's constantly notifying that it loses/reconnects to WiFi.  Perhaps related to WiFi6, but please…. -30dB at the door.  A nearly complete ""smart"" home with ~200 devices, and not a single one of any vintage has that issue.  That's inexcusable.  It reports battery percentage to the network (not to its app), which turns out to be just made up.  Without warning, after ~5-6 weeks, it just stops responding.  At an average Amazon price, batteries are about $1.25 each (x2), so ~$25 per year in batteries.  In comparison, similar replaceable Li batteries in a Kwikset Premis so far have lasted > 2 years, and are still at a true 60% (and that lock binds in the door jam).It does integrate well with HomeKit (and Home-Assistant), but the battery issue is totally ridiculous.  Not a single firmware update in over a year.  Will soon be replaced with something I don't have to babysit so regularly."
5.0,Battery Life is Horrible,"  This lock is simple to install, works great, and has probably the best app in its class. It also seems like a huge advantage that it connects directly to your wifi rather than to a bridge. But there is a huge cost for that: the battery lasts only about two months. A bridge allows the lock to connect to your network via low power Bluetooth, but maintaining wifi is a power suck that the two batteries can’t maintain for long. Our wifi router was 10’ from the lock, so distance was not a problem.We operate a vacation rental home so this is a major problem. But even if it were home home, who wants to change batteries on an essential component every two months?Do yourself a favor and get a lock with a bridge. Batteries can last a year or more."
5.0,4th Gen is awesome!,"  So i am coming from gen 1 August lock that used 4 AA and required a connect bridge to work remotely. I choose this brand for security reasons (encryption, authentication, and alerts tested @ DEFcon)  and reliability after testing many brands. My original lock recently died after years of use on multiple homes. I bought this one and am truly amazed how far they have come. 1st its 1/2 the size of the original yet the install is just as simple. 2nd the battery like is now much much better at ~3 months of everyday use. 3rd the wifi is now built in to the device no longer requiring the hub to connect. 4. the new door sense is a must feature letting you know if the door is shut securely. 5. the auto lock/unlock is much much more responsive and faster to operate based on your phones location.  6 it now auto switches from bluetooth to wifi automatically based on signal strength. Also the remote unlocking or giving a limited digital key to others you can revoke without having to give a physical key is great. On top of that it will log who when where and etc that key is used and alert you. Overall in my honest opinion its a much improved device that allows security and convenience that no other locks allow for. Highly Recommended!As a side note: i have installed and supported many types and brands smart devices. A large majority of the issues occur from ether the wifi network range/quality or the connected device used. Ie the network range of the 2.4ghz band or the resources, connectivity, or gps on the device used to connect.  if you turn off you connectivity to save battery this isnt going to work well. if your device doesnt have permissions or doesnt update the gps frequently this isnt going to work well. if you have a really old phone that is slow, has low memory, or connectivity restrictions (old wifi, bt, or cell band support) this isnt going to work well. Its not going to work well with any brand of smart device even a new top notch one like this. Make sure you have a good network signal to the location of the lock and that your device is able to support the app requirements."
5.0,The easiest setup possible - buy this lock,"  If you can use a screwdriver then you can fit this lock in less than 10 minutes - it's that easy.Installing the lock was breeze, the instructions are good except that I couldn't find out how to access the QR code (the front plate pops out when you press it revealing the QR code). No matter, I entered the serial number and all was well.The lock comes with a small magnetic sensor (you can see it in my image). I could have flush-mounted it but decided to surface mount it instead - it works great.I had issues connecting remotely when I was away from the house so I called support. They found the issue immediately (I was connected via Bluetooth only, not Bluetooth and WiFi). Support walked me through the setup and everything works great.I connected the lock easily to Alexa and everything is working great.Pro's:Very easy to install and set upWorks exactly as I wanted it toWorks with AlexaAmazing Support (the number is available on their website page)Con's:Actually, I haven't found any yet so i can only offer a positive review"
1.0,What good is this if creating an August accout doesn't work,"  I installed the lock today and the first thing that you MUST do is create an August account. I followed the steps to create the account but could not get past the second (email) verification step. The first step, a code to my phone worked the second time but after 6 attempts from 6 emails the only thing that finally happened was the code entry window locked up. It's Sunday but I thought I would try their support line. That call eventually timed out and a recorded message said to press 1 if I wanted a call back when someone was available. I pressed 1 and the call disconnected. It will be interesting to see if I get a call back since I was not asked for my number.Physical installation was very easy and only took a few minutes with one exception. There is a small piece of paper explaining in 3 lines what their smartsense technology does but no information about how to install the two pieces. Accessing their site just brought more frustration. clicking on one of the links, support in this case, does not work. The only way to traverse the site is by copying the link and pasting into the browser URL. There is no account log in either. How can this product get 4.5 stars? I will be returning this, the extra batteries I purchased, and the echo dot and look for something that's reliable."
5.0,Better than the original one,"  Previously I owned the 2nd Generation Lock. After over 5 years, it started having problems... and truth be told, I disliked how it so quickly ran thru batteries. Finally the lock gave out (which annoyed me because it was not cheap and one would hope would last for many, many years. Nevertheless, I had so enjoyed the functionality of the lock, I re-upped and purchased this model. I have had it for a couple of months and am THRILLED with it. First of all, installation is really simple... minutes! I like that it doesn't need the base module to connect. Also the form factor of this is much smaller than the original. And the battery life seems much better. This one includes features that my first one didn't. Again, not cheap, but totally worth the investment in my opinion. I hope i get many years of service."
1.0,I so badly wanted to like this thing.,"  After reading many reviews I settled on the August lock and this was the version I chose. It looks great, it sounds great, but that's where the great ends. First off, I sent a friend a code, a friend who is VERY tech savvy, and he couldn't get it working when he was trying to let himself in to our guest room after a long-haul drive and ended up sleeping in his car on our street instead. I was horrified. Then I got it working only by making him an 'owner' of the house which I would only be willing to do with people I trust...but I'm trying to use this for AirBnb so I need to be able to count on this for guests, not just friends and family dropping by randomly.So then I added the keypad as a separate purchase. After trying to get it work (and I am ALSO pretty tech savvy) for quite a while I had to call tech support and have them give me a special code to finally get the thing to work. Now it works via a code, but that even is hit or miss, you have to get your hand close to the pad to light it up, and even though I definitely know the code and how to do this, it takes me 2-3 tries every time before it will let me in with the code.Now trying to get it working with AirBnb. Tried to get the integration going...once again it just doesn't work. I do yet another AirBnb support ticket....come to find out after I set up the lock on my name and my husband set up our AirBnb listing in his name that this won't work...so I'm either going to have to factory reset the whole dang thing or make my husband re-create our listing in my AirBnb profile. Real fun lock, guys. REAL FUN. It might be easier to just train my cat to lock and unlock the door."
1.0,App has no idea the state of the lock,"  I got this deadbolt lock in a hopes to be able to easily manage access to my house. On the whole, installation was easy, and it worked just fine with my pre-existing hardware. However, this is basically where the value ends.Once installed you walk through a calibration test to get everything working as you'd expect from a smartlock. Getting the smart sensor in range was a bit annoying but wasn't too bad on the whole. I needed extra adhesive because they only give you one and I messed up. No big.The calibration has you lock the door, unlock the door, open the door, leave it ajar, and then close it again. This is where the process broke down quickly and I expected to have some issues moving forward. Once the initial part of the calibration is complete, the door starts trying to UNLOCK the door. Which is odd, because throughout the calibration process you'd have an unlocked door already, so the first action it should try is locking not unlocking. From here you basically get stuck in a loop during setup. If you manually lock the door, the app will unlock the door successfully and then go back to trying to unlock for some reason, even though it just took that action. I sat at my door for 10 minutes locking the door just to be stuck in this loop during setup.I figured, whatever, I really just want to be able to lock and unlock the door easily without needing my keys and be able to give people access without having to make keys. On the whole, that worked just fine, but the core issue remains; the app has no idea what state the lock is actually in at any given moment. Even while connected via BT, the app will not accurately reflect the state of the lock. If you open and close the app a few times, it will often ""catch up"", but thats no different than simply using a key.On the whole, I'll likely be in the market for a new lock altogether, as this one just doesn't even know how to properly communicate the device with the app and that is pretty important for my usecase."
1.0,Very Disappointed,"  I purchased this after happily using the 3rd Gen for almost 2 years. Design-wise I like the updated lock; it stops there. None of my invited Guests can unlock the door, the big circle remains gray. When I get home and a foot from the door it takes over a minute for my phone to connect. I keep getting warnings that the lock list WiFi signal even though signal is very strong. And let’s talk about lack of support.August took down the support phone number so email is the only option; and that has a very long response time. After emailing I get an automated reply stating because if Covid, Hurricanes, and Wild Fires support is slow. It’s been 6 months since Covid hit; how much longer will companies continue to use this excuse.I just ordered a replacement lock to see if I happened to receive a bad unit. Fingers crossed or I’m moving away from August.Update: was able to talk to someone at August after Amaon transferred the call.  August had me change the Guest access to ""owner"" and that person then could unlock the door. They said the will send the trouble ticket to the developers but don't know when a fix might be available. The security and lock experts suggest I give all users (dog walkers, cleaning lady and everyone else FULL/Owner access to my lock; what a joke!"
1.0,Buyer beware - this lock has some issues.,"  We've had this lock since August 2021.  There's pros, but there's also a lot of cons.Pros -Installation is a little tricky, but not overly difficult.  It is nice that it fits over an existing deadbolt which is one of its main selling points.  Fortunately for us, we didn't have any issue with the turning bit not working or anything like that.  Setting up the app was straightforward.  We have an eero mesh wifi system in our house which seemed to work well.Having multiple users and giving guest access is nice.  We had a dog sitter stay at our house for 8 days and had no issue with her using the lock.  It's nice to be able to give guest users access for a finite amount of time as well.  Nice and easy and you don't have to remember to disable access after a set time period.The alerts are great and work well.  You can have the lock give you a lot of alerts (door open, door close, lock on, off, etc) or only a little bit of alerts.Remote locking works great.  We've used it a couple times when we left the house and weren't sure if the door was locked.Cons -Battery life is an issue.  Our batteries needed to be changed inside of a 2 month span.  I think there are ways to lessen the battery usage but I don't know if it's going to really make a difference.  As many others have noted, the Gen 4 uses CR123A batteries which is mildly inconvenient.  I would recommend ordering a bunch on Amazon with your order if you decide to go with this lock.The auto unlock feature does not work 100% of the time.  The geofence radius is way too high and cannot be adjusted.  Again, mildly inconvenient when I go out for a run and come home only to have the auto unlock not work.Here's my biggest gripe - The lock has all of the sudden decided not to work.  We get a ""LOCK UNAVAILABLE"" error in the app.  There's almost nothing on the August help website that addresses this issue directly.  It goes through all the generic resolutions like restarting the app, changing the batteries, turn bluetooth on / off.  But there's no way to actually diagnose why the lock is ""UNAVAILABLE"".  We are now stuck with a lock that doesn't quite work, and i've tried to reset the lock multiple times.Miraculously the lock worked for about 12 hours, but now it's back to being unresponsive.  I will now have to do a deep dive into this by either doing a ton of google searches or spend time on the phone with customer service.With all said and done, i'm giving this lock 1 star.  For the amount of money we've paid, there's no reason why a lock should have this much trouble working as it should."
3.0,On the fence,"  I bought this lock back in April while purchasing a House. For other reasons, it only just got installed this last weekend. Worked as expected for the first three days.The app seriously leaves a LOT to be desired. The Settings page constantly refreshes when you are able to tap on something and then you have to find it again. I have a few other issues with it and Settings, but I'm still working through them and haven't confirmed if it's bad design or ""too high"" expectations.But a response from August says that you cannot create multiple schedules for the same type. Can't even remember what my original question was, but I want one that covers 23 hours every day.My problem right now is that the lock was unlocked via app at 5:15pm, locked via app at 5:16pm and then my lock went offline when being manually opened 30 minutes later. I cannot get it to come back online now, even after power cycling it twice.I've tried calling Support and got a message about ""higher than normal call volume"". Hold music is HORRIBLE. I would rather have nails on a chalk board than this xilofono(?).I requested a call back and after 2 hours haven't been called back.The Help Center is useless for this Lock too.I've worked in Customer Service for years. I've worked in technical support too. This hold time is disgusting.Chat tells you a Ticket was created, but I'm not holding my breath there.This is why you check things out during your 30 day window. Need to be able to return garbage, which is how I feel right now."
3.0,Very Finicky Wi-Fi Connection,"  When the lock is working, I absolutely love it.  I does everything I expect it to very smoothly and easily.However, with a fairly strong (-60dBm connection reported by my network controller), it is dropping connection 1-2 times per day.  Even when the lock is connected, sending it commands with Siri is frequently problematic, as although the lock executes the lock/unlock command, Siri almost always responds with being unable to verify that the lock performed the action, so I have to go back to the August app to make sure that the lock locked.This makes controlling the lock with Homekit automations pretty unreliable, which for a door lock is unacceptable.Update: 7 months later.  Never resolved connectivity issues despite August attempting to resolve with me.  They sent me a free August Connect (shouldn't need it for the wifi model, but they were willing to try it), but that didn't improve things.  I eventually moved an Access Point to within 15' and direct line of sight and that solved my WiFi issues, but the bluetooth connection still fails to reliably connect to HomeKit despite the home hub being <15' away.  It actually has just started showing up as always unavailable in HomeKit now and I've given up on trying to reconnect it anymore and just use the August app for controlling it.Also bought an August keypad to be able to one-button-lock the door when we leave, and that also has been a nightmare.  It works for a couple of weeks and then stops.  We've replaced the batteries in both the keypad and the lock (more on lock batteries in a bit), gotten it to reconnect for a bit, only to have it fail a couple of days to a couple of weeks later.Finally, last issue with it is that it consumes batteries like MAD.  I've been running it for only 7 months and I'm on my 4th set of lithium batteries.  So, do the math, each set of batteries lasts ~ 2.5 months.  I'm not buying cheap knock-off batteries, either.  These are Energizer Lithiums.I will say that as long as I keep putting fresh batteries in it and I try not to care about HomeKit (whole reason I selected this lock) and the keypad (their own product), it's been reliable otherwise.  We haven't had any issues with the app refusing to connect via wifi or bluetooth, issues locking or unlocking the door manually, or automatically unlocking when we arrive home.Despite that, I'll be replacing this as soon as I can."
2.0,August Support is Horrible,"  I've had it a week. Installing the lock was easy. Setting it up with my phone, a Galaxy S10, was difficult. After an hour, I finally got it paired from repeatedly attempting to connect, taking out the batteries, and trying different distances. It worked fine for two days. Day three, it would no longer connect with my Alexa. I have several other smart devices from other companies and those all work great, no problem connecting to my phone. In an attempt to reconnect it with Alexa I performed a factory reset. This time during setup it would not connect with my phone. I tried for 2 hours. I contacted August Support. After telling me to try most of the things that I had already tried. The conversation turned to my phone. Which is only 2 years old. Their support's solution then was for me to try it on a new phone and would not process a return until I did so. To keep it short, their support was horrible and offered no solution. I processed an exchange with Amazon who actually has great customer service. Im going to try one more lock and if it doesn't work Ill return it completely. Hopefully it works. But don't bother using August Support. They suck.*Update*I replaced the old August lock with an exchanged one from Amazon. I had a little trouble connecting my phone. But after restarting my phone I was able to connect it to the lock. I upgraded my review to two stars. Locking and unlocking through the August App is maybe 90% reliable. Performing voice commands through Alexa never works and I've disconnected it completely from my Alexa devices. It would always say that it is having a problem connecting to the device.  I'll just use the August App and the physical key. Don't trust the voice command aspect of this lock.  All in all not worth the money and I would suggest looking into another smart lock."
1.0,Not really HomeKit compatible.,"  Moving into a new home, my gen 3 lock was too far for a Bluetooth connection to my Apple TV. This lock installed fairly easily on the door, but connecting to wifi took no less than 10 tries and a factory reset of the lock. Once it was connected it worked fine through the August app. Adding to HomeKit was a different story though.Adding via the Home app shows the lock, but there is a “setup needed” status. I opened the August app and waited for Bluetooth and wifi to connect to my phone. Then returning to the Home app I now get “No Response” as a status.I deleted the lock from Home and perfumed a full factory reset. Another half dozen attempts to get wifi working. Opening the August app, going into the HomeKit settings it tells me to take the cover off the lock. I tap to continue and it spends about 10 seconds claiming to try connecting, then gives an object not found error and stops the HomeKit setup. I repeated this song and dance a dozen times before doing another reset of the lock. Another 10 or so wifi connection attempts then another half dozen HomeKit connection attempts.Then I came back to the Amazon app to return the lock. I have 20+ HomeKit devices all setup and working perfectly from lights to speakers to light switches to my TV. This is the only device that gave me any trouble, and it’s given me far more than it’s worth."
2.0,Lots of features but subpar battery life,  UPDATE: 5/2021 2 StarsThe WIFI connection drops constantly. I must have 20 other devices on the WIFI and they never drop. It either drops randomly and refuses to reconnect or when I make any updates to my network it does the same thing. Very poor.The pro lock has a ton of features but all those features come at a cost which is battery life. This lock doesn't take cheap AA batteries either like the last gen model it takes 2 CR123a's. With geofencing enabled you're lucky to get a month of battery life.Installation was easy but took some time to get everything connected to the app and integrated with Alexa. You can't only do 2.4GHz wifi. Make sure you have a separate 2.4GHz SSID as it refused to connect to my merged 2.4/5GHz SSID.When I upgraded my Ubiquiti access point to a Wi-Fi 6 model every Wi-Fi device in my house connected to it with no issues when I brought it online except the August lock. I had to factory reset the lock and reset everything in order for it to connect to Wi-Fi.I do still recommend the lock but 3 stars because of the poor battery life. With all the features enabled you shouldn't have to change the batteries every month. A rechargeable battery pack should've been used.
3.0,Battery Hog!,"  The lock in itself is good. Easy to configure. The unlock feature using phone is very useful. Lock feature using phone…. Not so much as it has been a hit or miss.However it has two big issues:1. The batteries last not more than 3 months. I probably use the software to open and close the door once a month, given we were mostly home during pandemic. However after installing this in late June, I’ve already replaced the batteries once and now in December it’s again reporting low battery. Don’t know what seems to be the issue. Why does the lock use up the battery if it is mostly operated manually!!2. The lock itself gives error 2 times out of 5 when attempting to close using software. As a result I no longer feel confident or remotely opening and closing it.On top of it, if it runs into an error, it continues to chime endlessly. Now a situation where you intend to lock the door without disturbing others at home, this lock is not for you.Very good concept but poor execution I must say. Honestly, to me it has been a waste of money."
5.0,"Wifi smart lock is a useful thing to have, but some features glitchy","  Frustrating install, but once finally done; I think it's great.  There were 3 install glitches I had to get through.1.  The mounting plate is thick enough that the existing bolts for the door lock weren't long enough.  So I had to go out to buy new bolts.2. There are several adapters to fit a wide range of ""tail pieces"".  This is good and bad.  There was more than one that fit mine.  Unfortunately I attached the wrong one.  What this did was allow the August lock to automatically lock, not automatically unlock.  I had no clue why the lock wasn't working correctly.  There were no install instructions which guided you to the ""wrong"" adapter possibly being installed and therefore the lock only partially works.3. There is a ""door sense"" sensor.  That helps indicate whether the door is completely closed.  The issue is it needs to be installed within 1.5 "" from the bottom of the dead bolt.  This seems easy unless on the frame of your door your dead bolt strike plate is extremely small.  Then mounting the sensor that close is not possible.Well all that said... There are some inconsistency with the function of the lock.  Mostly the geo fencing and the door sense doesn't work robustly, therefore you'll have to count on using your phone manually, or that the door isn't ajar by mistake.But that has worked great.  I can set temporary codes.  I can monitor the status of the lock by phone e.g.  did I remember to lock the door at night, or when I left the house.For me the pros out weigh the cons.  I like the functionality that does work."
5.0,…then why did you return it?!?,"  I absolutely loved this lock. WiFi built in, geo fencing, 50% smaller than its predecessor. Works with Apple Watch. Multiple account to see which family member is using it, a tech support division second to none! But wait, with all that good stuff, why did you return it? Well, when I was young, my father bought this 3/4 ton GMC Pick up truck that was as as ugly as sin itself. He loved it, I loved it, but my mom and sisters hated it. They complained until my father sold it......that was a very sad day for my father and me. The same is true with this lock, my family hated it and ridiculed it until I relented and returned it.I will buy again……I will buy again. Some day……some day."
5.0,Absolutely wonderful lock with a couple caveats.,"  Be sure you understand that this only works with a few deadbolts. It does not work with double keyed deadbolts. That is, deadbolts that use keys on both side of the door. Check out the the list of compatible deadbolts on the August.com website before buying; otherwise you may be buying a new deadbolt. I bought the Schlage B62 and am very happy with how the August Lock works with it.The only complaint I have is that the only option for auto locking is after a specified time. I wish geo-fencing based locking was implemented. Of course, this works fine with Apple's Homekit, but you have to acknowledge the automation every time–as if you wouldn't want to lock the door when leaving home!The August app even knows when I've left home (in the Autolock Function). Why wouldn't I want to lock after leaving home? I do love August's auto-unlock feature when I arrive home, but, you'd think that would be the time to require confirmation on my Apple Watch or iPhone! (Shhh, I like it the way it works!) However, the geo-fence based auto-unlock function works flawlessly and wonderfully.Also, it doesn't come in standard colors like other deadbolts (brass, antique brass, nickel, etc.). I really wish the inside part came in white, but it doesn't.If you've been working for the almost perfect door deadbolt that works with HomeKit, this is it."
5.0,Love the auto feature,"  Very happy overall with this lock. We were introduced to this when staying at an Airbnb. I love that it locks automatically when you shut the door! I also love that there is a keypad to open. We have downloaded the app on our phones and it works to unlock when I pull it up and manually press unlock on the app. What hasn't worked (disappointed!) is the Auto Unlock feature when it senses that I am returning home. This was an exciting option when choosing this type of lock! If my hands are full, I don't want to have to rummage for my phone, pull up the app, open, click the actual lock and then push unlock. Too much work! I end up using the keypad, which is ok, but wish the Auto Unlock feature would actually work. Set up took a bit. There were two of us working on install and set up and I would say safely allow an hour (depending on the lock that you are replacing, door etc) Maybe the 2nd one will be easier. We have other keypad locks on other doors, but this is preferable for me."
5.0,"Love this lock, can never forget to lock up","  Download the August app before you begin. Has step by step instructions.. for installation, calibration, door sensor, auto lock, auto unlock, and sends you to the website for Alexia or other smart home connections. The only issue I had was with the Alexia connection. Took me a couple of tries but got that working too. My garage door locks after a 5 min delay. Just bought another for the front door, plan on having it lock after 10 seconds. Lots of options can open the door from anywhere or send digital keys to friends. Dont know what more to say, I love this lock.8-18-21 Just got my second lock installed and working. Had lots of problems with connectivity this time. Come to find out my wi-fi was extremely slow at the time due to my ISP. The next day wi-fi was fine and I was able to calibrate everything and connect to Alexia without any problems. So If you have any installation problems check your wi-fi speed."
4.0,"Easy install, messy app experience","  First, the bad because that's what you're here for: The app is great when it works, but when it doesn't it just.... doesn't. There are 2 major categories of failure: UX + Technology. There are a lot of UX dead ends in the app where you can enter a step or process without being able to back out of it or step backwards. This was frustrating, but ultimately workable. The technology stuff was less so.On the tech end, the app crashed on first launch which was annoying and a lousy FTUE, but it's run fine everytime since. However, when I first installed the lock the app worked great for about 90 minutes. Then it started saying that it could find the lock, but pressing the button would do nothing. Or, worse, it'd mis-report the lock as incorrectly open or locked. Eventually it stopped finding the lock altogether. After an hour of banging my head against the wall I finally did a factory reset and re-setup the entire lock. It's been fine since, but it definitely spooked me. There have also been a few times when the lock can't quite close as far as it'd like and it just sits there grinding and beeping until I intervene, but that may be a calibration issue.The good: Install was dead simple, one of the simplest smart home installs I've done. The build quality is super high (I have less glowing thoughts about the keypad, but that's a separate review).  The app itself has a lot of videos and images to help and the walkthrough was simple. That said, Doorsense was confusing only because there's never a step where the app says: ""Here's all the stuff in the box"". I thought Doorsense was an add-on and had to back out of the app to realize I actually had it, as its hidden inside the box with the adapters. Seems like a strange oversight, but easily solved.All in all, it's a nice lock but I am wary about the longterm reliability of the app. I'll edit the review in a few months!"
1.0,Batteries only last a few weeks,"  Very disappointed with this lock. Looks good and works well. Unfortunately eats batteries at a fantastic rate. They last less than a month. I have the Eero Wifi 6 mesh network which may be part of the issue. If that is the case the disclaimer should be in the product description on Amazon!Looking for another make and will return it.Update: The return window is now closed for this product, it takes a while for this design error to show up so DO NOT BUY THIS LOCK IF YOU HAVE A MESH NETWORK.Yale will not stand behind its product."
1.0,I would not recommend this lock to anyone,"  I really wanted to like this smart lock, but it's honestly just terrible and unreliable.  I bought one in August 2020 (no pun intended) and installed it with no issue, but the app is horrendous and glitchy.  The calibration would not work and would freeze at the end of the process.  Once I finally got the calibration to finally complete after several hours, it would unlock fine, but every time I tried to lock it, it would tell me the door was already locked.  Therefore, I could unlock it with my phone, but would have to manually lock it each time.  What's the point?  I contacted their ""support"" desk, in which you can only leave a message and someone will contact you.  It took 9 days for someone to contact me and set up a video chat.  We scheduled a time and - go figure - no one ever contacted me.  It then took me an additional three attempts to get someone to actually video troubleshoot the issue with me.  After being on the video session with a support tech for over two hours, she finally determined I had a faulty lock and shipped me a new one (which took almost another two weeks to receive).Once I received the replacement lock, I removed the faulty one and installed the new one with relative ease.  This time, the calibration went smoothly.  I was pacified, as I just assumed I got a lemon unit the first time.  It worked reasonably well for 2-3 months, but the batteries were running out every 3-4 weeks!  The first two times I replaced the batteries, it was business as usual with no issues.  This last time, however, after I replaced the batteries, the lock is doing the SAME exact thing the original faulty one was doing - it will unlock through the app, but when I try to lock it, it tells me the front door is already locked (when it clearly isn't).  I've gone through the re-calibration process 20-30 times, but keep getting the same result.The entire purpose of a smart device is to make life easier and more efficient for people.  This device has done the exact opposite.  I've spent countless hours and effort trying to get this thing to work correctly, but to no avail.  The feature I really wanted with this was not having to fumble with my keys each time I get home, but ultimately that's exactly what I have to do in order to unlock my door.  At this point, I'm ready to remove the lock and just go back to a traditional deadbolt.  Essentially this thing was like flushing over $250 down the toilet (between the lock itself and all of the batteries I've had to purchase).  Do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS!"
5.0,"Eats batteries, prepare to buy lots of batteries often","  Like: reasonably easy to install. I like seeing the lock status on my phone, I like how it unlocks automatically when I get home.Like that I can’t tell from the outside that there’s a smart lock there.Dislike: often disconnects/reconnects to WiFi. My WiFi access point is less than 20 feet away from the lock.Dislike: battery life. The two batteries last about 2 months, at this rate I’ll be spending more on batteries than I did on the lock itself.  :-(Should I get the Bluetooth/WiFi bridge? Sort of defeats the benefit of having WiFi built into the lock, and another $80 for that?? If WiFi takes so much power they should have left it out and use the bridge thing."
5.0,Easy to install and works great.,"  I didn't want it to show on the outside that I have a digital lock.  There is no change on my front door.  The change inside is minimal.  I installed this lock in about 7 minutes.  I a woman in my seventies.  I am comfortable with computers, Alexia, and other apps.  This was very easy to do and works exactly how I wanted."
3.0,Worse than a Banking App...,"  Don't get me wrong; I love this lock... being the first WIFI enabled lock I've used.That said; August seems to be worse than Chase Bank with regards to application compatibility. They seem abandon Android OSes like they are going out of style. Apparently; they are too good to support older phones which don't have an upgrade path to later OSes. Instead; they expect you to throw out your perfectly good phone just to have the privilege of running their app so you can have auto-unlock capability.Fortunately; this was a relatively painful activity... have to risk a manual install of an older version from a APK repository which did support the version of android on my personal phone. I have basic functionality; but it was painful.Make sure you verify the latest Google Play version of the August App is available and installable on your phone/device BEFORE you buy these locks. Luckily; my wife had a cheap phone which was running a supported OS... so I was able to complete the install using her phone... then ""invite"" my older phone to the lock via her app. :rolleye emoji:"
5.0,A great Homekit/SmartThings smart lock,"  I also have the 3rd generation August lock, so I am comparing this with that model in some cases.  Overall, the newer lock is much smaller, uses different batteries (they last a long time for me!) and also is Homekit-compatible.I had a tiny bit of trouble during setup (my fault, I didn't *quite* follow the instructions), but I performed a factory reset, started over, and the second time it all worked out.Also included in the package is a sensor that tells you if the door is open/closed.  You can either mount on the door moulding (surrounding the door) or on the door frame itself (close to where the bolt goes Into the wall).I personally find the app easy to use and haven't had any trouble opening/closing the lock with my phone or even manually (by hand).  We also had a contractor working on our house and I was successfully able to issue a temporary ""key"" to them and they were able to gain access on specific days and within specific hours.Since I am also a SmartThings user, I was pleased to see that the lock also showed up in the SmartThings app and I able to see status and even operate the lock.Overall, this is a nice upgrade versus the prior generation (it's even easier to get the batteries in/out!) and I would recommend it also for users who are new to smart locks."
5.0,"Easiest install and pair. No more ""works sometimes"".","  I've been fighting with multiple IOT based locks for the side door on my detached garage, literally for years. Z-wave and Zigbee, with multiple controllers and repeaters. It has lost connection and needed to be re-paired so many times. Batteries die quickly. I finally threw all of that out and installed an August wi-fi lock.Install was painless, only needs a phillips screwdriver. Although I did opt to install the proximity sensor in the door frame rather than mounting with adhesive, so I needed a drill for that. The torque that the locking mechanism has seems much greater than the Kwikset models I had before. It is wifi, note that the instructions say it's only for 2.4GHz.I'll be working on pairing it to my Hubitat house controlled in the next couple of weeks, I will edit my review when I get that running (or not), along with comments about Alexa integration."
1.0,Slow grind to failure,"  This lock worked well for 6 months. Then, began to fail. It now burns through batteries in days (see battery type) It will not connect to active bluetooth. And it will NOT maintain a connection to the wifi network. I have an Orbi satellite 10ft from it, it is dual band. If you try and call customer support, you get a busy signal, every time. Try chat you say? You get a guy that always says he's sorry, that he understands but that he can't help you, that he'll have to escalate your issue to more experienced techs. Sadly, you get a robo receipt and then radio silence for months. So, complete failure over time, terrible, non existent customer support, zero accountability... Look elsewhere if you'd like to keep your lock frustration level capped."
1.0,Chews up plastic couplers and makes lock inoperable; does not support Homekit over Bluetooth,"  This interfaces with your existing lock’s tailpiece using a plastic coupler, which barely reached the tailpiece of my Schlage deadbolt. My door is a standard thickness. Even though the lock turned freely, after about 20 lock/unlock cycles, turning the knob to try to unlock the door, or using the motor, chewed up the end of the plastic connector, where it was barely touching the tailpiece, and it stopped turning the tailpiece and unlocking my door. This made the door impossible to unlock from the inside of  the house. Very dangerous in case of a fire—it became impossible to get out. A longer, metal coupler, instead of plastic, would have worked fine.Before that failed, it also refused to work with Siri which just always said “No response.” I learned that—for some inexplicable reason—its HomeKit integration does not use Wi-Fi and instead requires you to keep a Bluetooth-capable iOS HomeKit bridge near your door. Don’t take my word for it: search the August support website for “HomeKit no response” to see for yourself. My AppleTV is in my living room, not at my front door, so it’s impossible to unlock or lock this via the iOS ecosystem other than by using the August app.I was very excited to get this; that excitement quickly disappeared. I will be looking for a different option."
2.0,Battery life kills an otherwise decent product,  This is a nicely presented piece of kit. It works pretty well bar occasional but recurring connectivity issues. What seriously undermines this product is battery life. This is despite the fact that in our case it sees extremely low use. .e.g it probably is used to open or close the door about 3 or maybe max 4 times a week.VERDICT: For our very low end usage batteries need to be replaced monthly. That's 24 batteries a year. Good quality Lithium CR123's are not that cheap especially here in New Zealand.  So avoid unless you don't care about the environment and have nothing better to spend your hard earned cash on than batteries.
3.0,"Smart idea, dumb implementation. Disappointed for how expensive it is.","  I was super excited about this ""smart"" lock. Unfortunately I have a number of issues.It was not compatible with my lock so I had to pay $60 on Ebay for a machined aluminum adapter that could not have cost the seller more than $3 to make including time. A premium smart lock like August should support a premium deadbolt like Medeco. There is no reason they could not provide an adapter themselves, even if they sold it for $15 or $20.Also this lock seems to not always follow the auto-lock settings and sometime locks hours after I have entered the house, I know this since multiple times I have watched it lock while sitting on my couch.Additionally, the geolocation radius is laughably huge, and you cannot lessen it. It is especially troublesome for those of us who live in a more dense city environment. It often unlocks well before I am home and then it locks before I can enter. I don't know if it is more related to house density or the fact I have to walk up a flight of stairs from my sidewalk before entering. Either way it should have way more configuration.Now I don't feel comfortable taking a walk without talking a key with me."
5.0,"Fantastic smart home, smartphone, and cloud integration","  Bought a new home and couldn’t move in for a month. Setup the August wifi the same day the internet got setup. Been an Amazon user for years, setup my first Echo Dot and integrated it within 15 mins just using my iPhone. Love the integration to remotely lock, and love the peace of mind checking the August app to see the door is locked. The log of unlocking and locking is a great feature too. I also like that I can retain my key as a backup option. This is my best smart device!Wife approved and wife used, too!"
3.0,Disappointed. Misleading and terrible design decisions,"  Positives:- easy install- retains all features that you come to expect with august- door sense is a plus. Magnetic, didn't even need to mountNegitives:- features are weak- takes a long time to find the door after opening app. Like really long- claimed integration with smartthings but not really. It's more a workaround and very problematic. See next point.- biggest issue is constantly drops wifi connection. I've gotten to the bottom of it, the device is designed to use your Bluetooth on your phone and then toggle to wifi when Bluetooth is weak.The last point causes constant issues, I'll be returning it. Reason is that my house is large, even with router next to the door it connects to my phone via Bluetooth and then as I move away it switches to wifi and I get constant notifications that it's disconnected, then connected. You can turn notifications off but I sort of want to know when it legitimately disconnects.The constant use if Bluetooth kn my phone is a battery drain as well. They sheiks have done a proper zigbee integration if concerned about battery not leach onto a phones Bluetooth and have constant switching issues. Just a really crappy implementation choice."
1.0,Update broke the app.  Incompetent support.,"  Owners of short term rental properties using these locks beware!  The last app update prevents you from sending guest access invitations. I have had an open case that was supposedly escalated 3 days ago and was also supposed to get a call from a “supervisor “ - no one has called.  As a result, I have spent about 5 hours either on hold or talking with tech support to no avail.  I was also told I could not role my app back to the earlier version that did work."
2.0,Unreliable and Can You Leave you Hanging When You Need it Most,"  We wanted to love this product, as we own many home automation products that work very well. This is not one of them. There are issues across the board with the product and service. For one, auto unlock when you walk up to it has never worked for me except the first day we owned it. Despite setting the app to have extremely generous permissions (no battery save, full permissions, etc.) anytime I walk up, the door stays locked. When I open the app, it's often trying to connect and never does. I should note that our wifi network is very strong, going well beyond the distance of the lock, and my phone's bluetooth works from 20 feet away with other devices.It also loses its wifi connection frequently, requiring you to take the batteries out and re-insert them. Why is this an issue? Say you've gone away and need to let someone in remotely. Sorry, not going to happen. You're screwed.Worst, is support is a joke. There really isn't any. They just respond that they will keep working on the app in hopes of improving it. No warranty service. No real troubleshooting.Purchase this product only if you understand it is very much a beta and does not fully work properly."
1.0,If you don’t know what type of deadbolt you have. DO NOT buy this.,"  For over one year. That needs repeating. 13 months now i have been trying to get this installed. The product is an excellent one. But know that August doesn’t provide you a seamless integration nor experience and their customer service is wholly inept.I didn’t want to return the item. I have been trying for months and months and now stuck with it as i can’t return it and can’t get help to install it.This item does not work with double cylinder deadbolts.Let’s paint a picture. You buy a house, want to up the level of security and accessibility to those in the house so you opt for this vs the very one having a key. You know what your lock like from the outside but do you know what’s inside? Likely no.This has been my issue. I reach out to august and they tell me that i have a double cylinder but need a single cylinder. I tell them I’m prepared to buy that. I ask for their help, to recommend a deadbolt that is same color and shape that will fit my door and work. They reply. With a link of DOZENS of deadbolts. Which meant i have to do click each one to attempt to find one that is matte black and square.You’d think a lock company would have an expert that this can escalate to in order to make a recommendation. You would think. But no. Instead i have circular conversations with what is clear an outsourced, non U.S. support team who know nothing about the locks in the US and only have scripts to forward. It’s been one year of this.As of today i at the stage of having had to engage a locksmith co whose quote shows a charge for the visit plus a charge for the locksmith plus the lock plus an install fee.I don’t know what to do. I can’t return, I’m outside the window. I can’t get the thing install. I can’t believe august can’t do more than send me to link to their webpage which is a summary of links to other websites that lists and sells locks.Their customer service is not service.The one star is because the reviews suggest it is a good product.  What the reviews won’t tell you is what would happen if you don’t have a compatible deadbolt and need help.I’m hoping this might lead to someone at august feeling some sense of disgust that a paying customer would have such an experience and offer to help.Based on my experience with august locks i don’t expect this to happen."
1.0,"Great features, terrible app, terrible new lock version (4th gen)","  We had the original August Smart lock and it was great - auto-locked, auto-unlocked, guest codes worked and notifications worked. When it came time to replace it we went for the new (4th gen) version. It had good reviews, same features, was a bit smaller and didn't need a 'connect' bridge. However, the first one we received would rarely send notices when the door opened or closed - just enough to let us know we'd set up the notifications correctly and that it was failing to send intermittently.  The August app would show the correct lock status but the Apple Home app wouldn't. Calibration would fail or last a day. The lock would recognize that we'd come home about 1/2 the time - we'd have to open the app and unlock the rest of the time. So we returned that one and got another one. This one had similar problems and additionally would occasionally get stuck trying to lock endlessly, even though the bolt was properly deployed. This happened overnight twice and both time because notification didn't come through, it ran down the batteries and was dead in the morning. August support, troubleshooting and documentation are definitely lacking. We're returning the latest lock and switching to try something else."
4.0,Terrific customer service,"  I'm fairly handy, or like to think I am, but I could not get the lock to work. It seemed confused and though the help screens are well designed, I couldn't figure it out. I asked to speak to someone and after a fairly long wait got a young woman (I'm almost 80. I can say ""young woman."") on the line and she guided me through a number of steps, me sitting in front of the door, trying each step, sometimes two and three times. She stuck with me.  She was ever patient, even when I second-guessed her and tried things on my own. It turns out that choosing the wrong adapter (the little plastic rod that connects the lock stem) does confuse the lock so its behavior doesn't seem at all logical. She figured it out though, despite my mistakes and bull-headed insistence ""that couldn't possibly be it."" Very patient, very professional, very polite, even comforting when I began to realize that part of the problem was me ""knowing better"" than what she was telling me. Above and beyond what customer service should be. I'm a fan, and I love that my door locks itself when I leave and unlocks it when I come home. Thank you, August."
3.0,Great Smart Lock but very poor application for Android - bad connectivity and software,"  While I like my August Wi-Fi smarlock, I am very unhappy with the poor integration with the Android app.Much of the expected functionality and automation is missing without the android app working well.  This takes away from the total experience.I really hope August Smart Lock fixes this as its a great product - but falls significantly short on the Android Platform.  This is really frustrating especially since Android is the largest platform - makes no sense.Here are the issues:- it doesn't connect consistently- it says its connected, then it will disconnect without telling you, very difficult to change settings due to this.- the wi-fi connection is iffy, this limits your ability to remotely lock and unlock (which is one of the main reasons I purchased it)- there are no widgets- to use the app for locking/unlocking - you have to open the app, log in, wait for the app to connect and then press the unlock/lock button.  A simple widget to unlock and a simple widget to lock - oh my - how much better woudl THAT be?Some other issues:- the 'smart sense' doesn't work with metal door frames - as it is magnet driven.  In itself that isn't a huge deal - BUT WHY DON""T YOU TELL ME THIS UP FRONT.- Connecting to Wi-Fi - is very bad.  I had to move my mesh AP within 12' for the lock to connect.  That's pretty lame actually.  I was fortunate that I was able to relocate an AP to w/in 12' but many people may not.Outside the issues - this really is the smart lock to buy.  No need to replace your lockset or have anything on your exterior telling everyone who wants to know you are using a smartlock (the August Lock goes only on the interior - and it looks pretty good).I really like I don't have to lock the door behind me when I leave home - and would like not having to unlock the door when I arrive -if the software and connection problems are resolved (it works 75% of the time - not enough to leave my keys at home)"
1.0,"Easy installation, but buggy technology and horrible technical support","  The first unit was completely dead. Would not successfully update the firmware. I tried everything their support department gave me, which was a never ending stream of different ways to ""turn it off and turn it back on again."" I exchanged the lock for a new one. That one was able to get the firmware updated, but we could not add any additional users to the lock. The text message invitations would not go through. Again, we contacted support and we got the same type of ""turn it off/on again"" type of tier one advice. Then, the lock was completely lost to the only phone that could connect to it before and we couldn't get it reconnected. I returned it. Obviously, other people had success with this lock, but it was certainly not a good experience for us."
4.0,Great product but Wifi drains battery,"  This is my 2nd August, had an older model that required the August bridge to connect to wifi. Upgraded due to the smaller form factor and read online that the wifi connection is more reliable (the older unit worked 95% of the time, but when when you hit that 5% it was very frustrating). Battery life on this 4th gen unit with built in wifi (no bridge needed) is horrible. I got about 3 weeks of battery, and it takes rather expensive Lithium batteries now, not the regular AA like the older unit). In August's defense, their tech support was easy to reach and they shipped me a new bridge free of charge and instructed me how to bypass the built in wifi and connect through the bridge instead. Not sure if this fixes the problem, but it makes sense. If it didn't work I'll report back, but I trust this will do the trick. Highly recommended otherwise. It's one of the only (if not the only) smart locks that keeps the exterior of your lock the same and it's reliable, much more so that my older unit. At least when the batteries are full :). Fingers crossed."
4.0,Good Lock With Annoying Issues,"  I own 3 August Wifi Locks and have bought two more for my daughter & son-in-law. I'm generally very happy with the performance of the locks, but there are some annoyances that any potential buyer should be aware of.  First is battery life. The August App gives no indication of the status of the batteries, then suddenly, you start receiving e-mails and notices that your batteries are ""critically low"" or ""almost drained."" Initially, I changed the batteries when I got the first notice, but the batteries I removed tested as good as the new batteries I put in. Finally, I decided to test one lock to failure. Twenty-one days and twenty-seven e-mails later, the lock finally failed, flashing green and refusing to connect to the app. I replaced the batteries, and my tester reported ""Replace"" for the removed batteries. I have filed a support ticket to ask for a way to disable the worthless low battery warnings. I think the problem is that August put too much into the lock, depending on battery power - the motor, a Wifi radio and a Bluetooth radio. Hopefully Thread will enable better Bluetooth performance and will enable us to turn off the Wifi radio, which should increase battery life.The second issue is poor HomeKit performance. I added my first August Lock to HomeKit, but then I quickly removed it after I tired of Siri telling me she was unable to connect to the lock or could not even find my lock. I blame Apple for this, more than August, because I think Bluetooth is a very poor way for HomeKit to connect to external devices. In my experience, the only devices that work well with HomeKit have their own hub to enhance communication. Devices, like August, that try to work without a hub, suffer from poor communication which often prevents them from working with HomeKit at all. Again, I'm hopeful that Thread will improve this situation, but it might require buying the next generation August Lock to get the benefit.  The August App is excellent and offers control from my Apple Watch, so I really don't miss the HomeKit integration. I just think prospective buyers should know about this."
5.0,Really happy with it!,"  We installed this lock at our apartment. It’s awesome that you don’t have to change out the deadbolt, so it’s renter friendly. We had a little difficulty installing because our deadbolt required longer screws than what came with the lock. We had to order them through August for $5 extra. I wish they would have just included them in the box, but maybe it isn’t a common issue.The lock itself works really nicely. I love auto-unlock for when my hands are full! It’s really nice to just walk up to the door and open it instead of digging around to find my keys. I also like that we have the ability to let guests into our apartment if we aren’t there.Overall, I’m really happy with it and would recommend it to anyone. It’s very convenient on an everyday basis  and very nice to have as a backup if you ever forget your keys somewhere."
1.0,Disappointing,"  I really wanted to like this lock but I ran into several issues when trying to install on a Baldwin deadbolt.The lock uses a plastic insert to connect to the lock spindle.  The insert really should be longer because it does not engage over much of a distance.  After a couple of attempts to get it working, the insert showed signs of wear because of the short engagement distance.The outside of the plastic insert has projections like a gear to connect to the August lock.  The app shows that the lock installs with the August label projection at 12 o'clock but it clearly cannot (at least for the lock I received).My lock failed calibration.  It then said I needed to recalibrate and then got stuck recalibrating.  If I started over, the app would immediately fail calibration, provide the option to recalibrate, and then hang.I tried calling customer support.  On the first attempt, the digital assistant got stuck in a loop of asking me repeatedly if the lock was installed and ignoring my answer.  I tried calling a second time, and the system recognized I had already called and tried connecting me to a person.  Periodically, it gave me the choice to schedule a call back time but it would just put me back on hold with no indication of the hold time.  After 45 minutes - I gave up.At this point, my wife pointed out that the lock is much bulkier than it appears in the pictures.  Instead of fighting with it any further, we gave up and returned the lock."
1.0,Works when it wants to - which isn't very often,"  From the very beginning Alexa was telling me the status was locked when it wasn't, telling me she locked it when she didn't, and it was unlocked when it wasn't. That is not only a major problem but seriously unsafe. Tried to contact the company numerous times and the hold time just gets longer and longer. ""Your estimated hold time is 7 minutes... Your estimated hold time is now 23 minutes... Your estimated hold time is now 38 minutes..."" WTH? Clearly a POS device with a company that doesn't seem to be very tech savvy with anything. Thought it would be a neat addition to my smart home, hassle-free and make life easier, but the truth is it just caused brain damage. AVOID THIS JUNKER"
1.0,Waste of money,"  While the lock works well, I have lots of issues waiting for auto unlock to work.  I typically wind up using my key to open the door instead of it being open when I get to it.I requested a replacement but they said it's a software issue.  I find hard to believe as my son has two and doesn't encounter problems which was why i bought it.  I have the same phone and software version he has so i find it hard to believe it's a software issue..Also, beware as the batteries only last about 3 months and you don't want to buy locally as they are expensive.  Order from Amazon, a lot cheaper considering I'll be going through 8 a year.Thoroughly frustrated and had thought of buying a second one, but won't waste a penny on another one."
1.0,GARBAGE - just total garbage...  Oh Yeah - and ZERO customer support,"  If you are an Apple Homekit user forget about this one...  I installed the first one and got it installed with Homekit right away...  I could lock/unlock it with Home on my iPhone, but the first time I tried to use Siri to do the same she told me ""unable to complete your request - open Home""...  Then in Home the lock showed ""no response""....  I reset the lock in their app and went through the process at least 4 times - all with the same result...  Called their ""support"" line and all you get is an automated system that will send you ""helpful"" information to your phone via text, but you literally can't get through to actually speak to someone...OK - maybe I got a bad lock...  Sent it back to Amazon and they sent me the same one...EXACT same BS...  If you use Homekit - don't waste your time on this pile of garbage or the non-supporting company that sells it..."
5.0,Works great if phone settings are correct,"  I almost did not buy this because of some of the reviews that said it worked sporadically. The main feature I wanted was the auto unlock. Installation and setup was a breeze. The first time I tried the auto unlock it did not work. Finally resolved issue. If you are having problems with connection and you have an android phone,, try these steps.1. Make sure the lock is connected to a 2.4G network. Your phone can be connected to 5G if you have a dual band router.2. Make sure ""Turn on wi-fi automatically"" is turned off. It is found in settings > connections > wi-fi then press the three vertical dots in the top right hand screen.3. Make sure you do not have you phone in power saving modeThis resolved my problems. Works like a charm now."
1.0,"Terrible support, doesn't work half the time","  I had high hopes for this despite the spattering of negative reviews. Well, it fell flat on its face. The lock fails to connect to both my Galaxy S20 Ultra and my Wife's Iphone XS Max half the time. While i have my router about 5 feet from the lock, it disconnects and reconnects to my network about 50 times per day, sending me a notification every sing time. Oh what's that? You disconnected again? Ya don't say. A SUPER fun side effect of all this network exploration is that in 6 months of ownership, I've replaced the batteries 8 times! Cool! What does August have to say about this? Well, first they asked me to reset the lock. Thank god, i would have never though of that. Then they asked if my router was within 10 feet of the lock, and when I told them it was less than 5 feet away, they asked if I can move it closer. After 20+ emails back and forth, they finally agreed to send me an August connect bridge to fix the connection errors, great! Which will be available in SEPTEMBER 2022, not great! Then, after even more emails, they finally agreed to replace the lock, about a month ago, of which I have yet to receive and have no more communication. But hey, it's easy to install."
3.0,Updating firmware issue!,"  The hardest part was the installation!  I was trying to install the firmware update with the Galaxy Note 9 and I kept on getting random issues.  Sometimes the process would halt at 3% and other times it would halt at 97%.  I would follow all the recommendations such as force stopping the app, shutting down your phone and do a reset on the device by taking out the battery and still had the issue of installing the firmware update.  I called August and we went through the same process and had the same results.  They recommended try using another phone but the Note 9 is the only phone I own.  I borrowed a friends iPhone and I was finally able to update the firmware but I still had issues with calibration.  I then tried different deadbolt connection piece that comes with yourvlock and then it worked great.  I was then able to connect it to my wifi without any issue and even registered a strong signal.  I do not understand the premises of integration with alexa because you still need your phone for security purposes to unlock it.  The installation process should have been easier and kinks need to be solved and a step by step recommendations to resolve issues should be a part of the installation process.  I do not understand why I am able to use my Notr9 with my lock but not being able to install a firmware update.  Amazon is sending me a replacement and I will be able to determine if its a lock issue or a phone issue so if I am able to do the update with the new lock, I will be sending this one back otherwise I will send the replacement back....stay tune!"
2.0,Android Users Beware,"  Android users look elsewhere.As an Android user, it surprises me to see the great ratings for this lock. While the lock itself is pretty amazing, the connectivity and challenges for Android users do not allow WiFi functionality at times- only bluetooth, which vastly limits the reliability / usability of this lock. From the reviews, it must work amazingly well on Apple, but set up (location identification) and inconsistent WiFi issues create too many roadblocks to make this a worthwhile effort. August customer support acknowledges the Android problems, and says they are continuing to work on it. But after several years of issues, they still have not been able to create a reliable software product for the Android platform. How they continue selling this with no advisory of the above makes me doubt the trustworthiness of this company. The Gen 4 lock has been on the market for a year and a half, which seems easily enough time for August to overcome these Android challenges."
3.0,Mine is saying it's locked when it isn't,"  I paid a locksmith to install the device, and it works all right except for one feature, when I press the ""lock"" button, the bolt moves only partially out of the housing and fails to secure to the door frame.  I can always remedy this by pressing ""unlock"" and then ""lock"" a second time, this times to pull the bolt back for a second try and it has been working (thus far) on the second attempt.This is inconvenient in that I have to visually check the lock to be sure it is locked in fact (I can see the bolt in the small gap between door and doorjamb).  This bolt is new and parts of it are made of stainless steel, as it must endure the weather.  Using a key sometimes required a struggle, too.So it may be the bolt itself and not the August Smartlock, but I feel I need to mention this to potential customers.  I wouldn't dare risk trusting this to lock my door unless I could visually check each time, which kind of defeats the idea of this lock."
1.0,App is TERRIBLE if you have more than 1 lock,"  As others said, install is SUPER easy.But the SMART part is why I bought the lock. If you only have 1 lock, this wont matter, but if you have more than 1, the August Smart Home App is TERRIBLE.1st - Rearranging the order the locks show up in the app is a guessing game, no option to set which lock shows up first and which shows up last. Also, it DOESNT seem to do alphabetical or numerical order either, ITS RANDOM, called the August help phone # and ITS NOT DOABLE!!!!!  I named 2 locks starting w/ A and another with B, but it puts the locks in order of A-B-A.. IT MAKES NO SENSE FOR SOMETHING THIS SIMPLE TO BE THIS HARD on a $200 Lock!!!!2nd -  Auto-Unlock ONLY works on 1 lock, its a forced app 'feature'. Again, I have 3 locks in the house and my front door has a screen door lock, so 2 locks total on the front door, but I cant auto-unlock both locks.3rd - Auto-Unlock seems to be hit and miss, it works most of the time, but not all the time."
3.0,"When stars are aligned is great, we know how unlikely that is","  I’ll start by saying this, the job to be done for me is so I can lock and unlock my door without taking the key out of my pocket. The solution is not to replace the key with a smartphone, because that is even more hassle. Imagine on an iPhone, I have to do a Face ID tap on August, find the lock and then unlock. I might as well just get the key instead.Ideally the Auto Unlock is enabled when I want to. I should be able to set the Auto Unlock when I leave the house, which then would immediately lock the door. But it doesn’t work that way. I have to be a couple of blocks away to enable this feature which doesn’t apply to a majority of my day to day use case.I can live with this if the Siri integration is done correctly. Most of the time Siri would always say hmmm or it shows no response on the Home page. I tried so many things to no avail. I have an awesome signal and download speed even in my garage. I have extenders everywhere. I can also excuse this if Watch OS is integrated correctly, most the time though I can’t unlock through my watch either.It’s such a poor implementation but I don’t know if there is any other alternative out there. I’m just hoping they would fix this right away."
1.0,Doesnt work with Google Nest. Love that it works with existing deadbolt.,"  Works great. Ihad gotten all the way to work when I realized I forgot to lock the door. I locked it from the app. Loving this smart lock so far. No complaints. Easy install and set up.0712/21: I have changed my review based on poor communication and the smart lock pro+connect 4th generation does not work with the Google nest video door bell. I sent a message to August on their Facebook (Which is what they have asked other customers with issues and concerns to do.) After 24 hrs, I haven't heard back from them.This is the message I sent.  I recently purchased and installed the smart lock pro 4th generation.  I was really liking it until I was advised by Google tech support that the lock was the reason my Nest video door bell stopped working. They stated it was because of the different frequencies between the lock and the doorbell. is there a work around or update for this? if not, I will have to return it.I purchased this so my daughter wouldn't have to fumble to find her key when she starts school. If the lock does work in conjunction with my other security measures, it does me no good."
1.0,SHORT BATTERY LIFE; Poor Customer Service response,"  I liked how easy it was to install.I hate that it requires 2 expensive batteries that nearly lasted 4 months, even though the lock was never used other than initial setup and testing.I found the Customer Service to be slow and unresponsive to the issue of SHORT battery life.  They take days to respond to each inquiry.  They ask questions, and then follow up with more questions that have already been answered, rather than provide a solution.I wish I had read about the short battery life issue described in online forums before I bought this August lock.  I’ve had great results from a Qwikset smart lock, which I would highly recommend."
5.0,Get good WiFi kids and this lock is great,"  For all the folks leaving negative reviews: Step your WiFi game up.This lock has WiFi built in, unlike the previous models so if you have sketchy WiFi the lock won’t perform the same. I’m not sure if you can supplement your WiFi with an August Bridge(which I still use for my previous models) but if you can, buy one. Battery drain is also dependent on a strong WiFi connection. Sketchy WiFi equals sketchy battery life.Lock is great. Love the smaller footprint. Love that it has WiFi built in (because I have great WiFi lol).Works GREAT with the keypad. I only suggest installing the keypad closer to eye level if you go with one. Aligning the keypad level to the lock just makes life harder."
1.0,Consumes Batteries Very Quickly,  I would have given this lock a 5 star but this thing goes through batteries like crazy. I have to locks and they each use at least one battery every 30 days. The lock that gets the most use may be less that 30 days. This may not seem to be a lot but a 12 pack of batteries cost $26. So you have a $4 plus dollars a month maintenance fee per lock. Very disappointed.
2.0,"Issues with Auto-Unlock, HomeKit and abysmal support","  Update 09/2021 : After trying to use this with home assistant and the web api being so slow that locks/unlocks would take anywhere from 10 to 30 seconds, sometimes even never, I broke down and purchased Gen 3 of this lock, added it with Z-Wave and it’s almost instant, up to 3 seconds. Oddly the HomeKit integration is also working reliable and instant. Gen4/WiFi is smaller but definitely inferior when it comes to home automation integration.I‘ve had it since October, the return window is closing 01/31 and I am inching closer to just be done with it.Auto-Lock - Excellent : in combination with Door Dense is awesome. You arrive or leave and the door immediately (adjustable) locks back up. Other locks that don’t sense when the door gets shut will lock only based on time which is not usable. The dog is lagging, you’re carrying something through. The time is never the same and if you set it too long it feels unsafe too.Auto Unlock - Useless: we have this at a condo door, if I take the dog out and return there is no Auto Unlock. This maybe okay if you left for work somewhere. But even in a house if you had a detached garage and locks on it and the house, you’d be fumbling for your phone or keyLow Battery Alerts - Annoying: we have been getting critical battery alerts for weeks now and I am just pushing my luck I guess. I took out the battery, tested it and it seems still juicy. I am not going to throw away batteries prematurely, it should warn when it’s actually critical not multiple times a day weeks aheadHomeKit - Not responding. I get a Home notification when the lock is locked or unlocked manually or any other way. The locks shows in Home, but it simply can not be controlled from it. It reads not responding. The AppleTV is 15 feet from the lock. I have followed any Info I was able to find, completely set everything back up too, it just doesn’t work.Battery Life - okay: not sure what is advertised but it seems 2 months is itSupport - non-existent: I was never able to contact a human to troubleshoot some of the issues and I am not going to wait for hours in a queue.Bottom Line: we use a key, it’s the fastest way in. The auto lock is however perfect and works great. I’d rather have a look that excels at both"
4.0,Built-in WiFi is a Plus,"  My first generation August lock died recently (internal gearing issue I think from the sounds), and required a separate bridge to connect to our home WiFi for HomeKit support.  It worked, mostly. This new smaller August has WiFi built-in, so after initial Bluetooth setup it worked fine, again mostly.  I haven't noticed any remarkable connectivity improvements, but definitely like the smaller size.  We use Apple HomeKit for our home automation, and our August locks are a key part of that.  It's hard to say why invoking Siri to lock/unlock a door continues to be sluggish, but I guess it's probably on the HomeKit secure authentication side, which requires a trip to an Apple server to execute.  If you're standing by the lock with your iPhone and want to lock/unlock the door, with the direct Bluetooth connection, it's essentially instant."
2.0,Not ready for prime time,"  To avoid confusion, this review is for the August WiFi (4th Gen) Smart Lock (no hub needed). After reading many “professional reviews” in leading magazines for several weeks, I invested in four of these locks for my moderate-sized home, along with the keypad accessories for each (Nov 2020). The intent was to integrate them into my Apple HomeKit system.The physical installation was straightforward, and relatively painless…if you can change a door lock you’ll be done in five minutes. The exception being the installation of the included DoorSense system (a nickel-sized magnet and receiver), which I needed to sometimes install burrowed into the door jamb, other times surface-mounted on the door or casing, depending on the vagaries of house door installations - all variations were approved through calls to tech support.The device itself seems sturdy, and provides a good grip when you’re wearing mittens or bulky winter gloves, or are trying to open it using a pinky because your hands are full… Which brings me to the problems…The DoorSense system is flakey at best - roughly every ten days or so I must recalibrate the system so that it reports correctly whether the door is open, closed, or a bit ajar. Very annoying when I am snuggled in my 3rd floor bedroom and need to trudge to the basement to verify the door is indeed locked and closed, despite what the app says. This recalibration is needed roughly equally on all four doors, regardless of how I mounted the sensors or where the door is located.The lock settings may only be configured when you have a Bluetooth connection with the lock, thus only when you’re standing within a couple of feet or so - you can’t change a setting remotely (say, adding a smart alert or toggling the geofencing function).The app is just bad, and unreliable. Daily, the app misreports the status of one or more of the locks - often when I’m standing right in front of it. This is truly a problem when I’m standing on the OTHER side of the door, which happens often enough that I’ve resorted to carrying my house keys again, and have given one to each of my neighbors - the very thing this lock should render unnecessary.On average, the auto-lock/unlock feature fails once every three or four days, which requires me to set down my armful of groceries and kids, root for my phone, see if the app is reporting correctly, and then - often as not - reach in my pocket for my keys. Too many times I have come home find the doors never locked at all, despite the app saying they did (and still were).HomeKit integration has never worked. Not once. Automations, ShortCuts, Siri commands, all report “device not responding,” this despite my having over 30 other smart devices (Eve, 2 ecobee thermostats with 14 sensors, Wemo, Chamberlain MyQ, and Hue) that usually work just fine. I eventually just removed the August locks from HomeKit because they kept failing the automations and messing everything else up.August tech support is fond of blaming spotty wifi service for these failings, but I happen to have a hi-end mesh network which blankets the house and grounds (4 eero Pro 6 units, highly recommended), and, other devices immediately alongside the locks register full signal strength, as is also reported by the locks themselves in the eero utility app. Two of the locks are actually within line-of-site of the WAPs, and yet all four drop out repeatedly and for extended periods of time, for no apparent reason. Again, for all other units in the HomeKit system the WiFi is rock solid for weeks on end.Finally, the most disappointing aspect is the miserable battery life of these units. I have been averaging just over a month per set of batteries before the units report they are critically low on power. I have begun writing the dates on the batteries to keep track of consumption. The batteries in the photo were newly installed on July 16, 2021, and of this writing it is August 31, 2021. This remains roughly true across the several brands of high-end batteries I have tried (thus far Panasonic seems to have a slight edge, of a week or so).This is promising tech, that I desperately wished was better implemented so that it delivered on the advertised lifestyle improvement. Unfortunately, as of now, the results are far too spotty to be relied upon for daily use and home security.I suppose I will re-evaluate August when the inevitable 5th Gen arrives to the breathless accolades of the fanboy reviewers in the glossy magazines, but I won’t be buying four again."
1.0,Not Ready for Consumers,  I bought this lock to automate my house lock.  It installs very easily and looks great.It does not work as advertised.I am afraid it will unlock my house by accident.  It does not integrate with Alexa well.  I would absolutely not trust this lock from far away.  Over half the time I check the lock with my phone it says it cannot connect whether connected by wifi or bluetooth.  It unlocks my house about 5 minutes after I get home even if I open the app outside.  I have been through all the trouble shooting and changed all the recommended settings on the lock and the phone to get it to work better.  I do not recommend this lock.
1.0,Horrible. Do not buy this system.,"  As a smart home engineer and tech guy, I can simply advise you to avoid this system at all costs. It drains batteries in under 30 days, support takes nearly a week to respond, and the design of the system is abhorrent. This thing consumes batteries in under 30 days Per lock, and they are the more expensive batteries. When I contacted support they sent me additional piece of hardware (connect) to try to make it work, but it only fixed half of the issue. I have tried for far too long to make the system work properly and since I am beyond the return window for Amazon, now I will have to scrap it and start all over again at my own cost. Extremely disappointing, stay away from this product line!"
